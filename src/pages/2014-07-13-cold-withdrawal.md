I consider myself to be a glacier,

moving inch by arctic inch and

breaking apart invisibly,

always in a slow retreat.

I’m an avalanche when moments don’t matter,

but packed ice when they do,

sealed tight for fear of shattering,

wearing my white mourning garb for

the crevasses that still

cut through,

old scars that erode me anew.

Sliding away,

piece by icy piece,

I give,

because I don’t know how to take.
