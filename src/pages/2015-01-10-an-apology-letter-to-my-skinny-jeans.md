    Dear Pink Skinny Jeans,&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    It&#8217;s been a long time, hasn&#8217;t it? I honestly forgot you existed until I pulled my pants drawer open today and saw your bright, happy tint pushing through the dark murk of denim and business casual black.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    I&#8217;m sorry. I haven&#8217;t meant to be so distant, but then again&#8230;maybe I have.
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    At this point, I&#8217;ve forgotten when I got you, only that it had to have been at least three years ago. Maybe it was for Christmas or my birthday. I don&#8217;t know. All I know is that in those three years, I haven&#8217;t worn you once.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    I&#8217;ve kind of hated the thought.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">

  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    You see, I always thought that if I wore you, I&#8217;d look bad. That your light color would make my hips look extra big and my legs extra chubby. I always felt extra self-conscious looking at you and knew people would stare if I walked around wearing you. So I stored you away and haven&#8217;t touched you since. I made it my life goal to avoid light-colored pants, and you were no exception.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    Until today.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    Today I pulled you out, lovingly unfolded you, and thought to myself, &#8220;Huh. Let&#8217;s try this again.&#8221;&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    I slipped into the bathroom and slipped you on, loving the way you fit snugly around my waist and legs. When I looked in the mirror, I didn&#8217;t see big hips or legs. I saw a girl rocking a pair of pink skinny jeans and not giving one iota about whether or not they increased the width of her thighs. How many things have I kept myself from wearing or doing because I&#8217;ve been afraid of what people might think, I now wonder. How many things might I like if only I would get over my reservations and the opinions of society? Probably a lot.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    So today, I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    I&#8217;m sorry I cared so much more about how I might look than about wearing a color that makes me happy. I&#8217;m sorry I based my self-esteem on something so trivial. I&#8217;m sorry that I made the perceived width of my hips priority number one instead of my ability to express myself. &nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    I kind of like you, Pink Skinny Jeans, and I don&#8217;t really care what I look like when I wear you.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    Let&#8217;s hang out more often, okay?
  </div>

    Love, <br />Ari
