If you are familiar with Mormonism and General Conference, you may remember this announcement from last October:

What was I doing following this announcement? Crying. Like a baby. Even now when I listen to it I cry like a  baby. It was incredible. 

My first instinct was this: I really want to go with them right now. I want to join this new wave of missionaries going out to teach the Gospel so badly. 

After two or three days, I started feeling like it probably wasn’t going to happen. And it was painful to come to that conclusion. Everybody was asking, “So when are you going to go?” And I kept having to say, “Not right now.” 

After my brother’s Seminary Graduation on Sunday, I started to wonder. 

I’m going to be as honest as I can be with you right now: I don’t know for sure if I will, but starting now, I’m going to be turning to my Heavenly Father and asking Him if I should serve following my college graduation next spring. I want to serve. We’ll see what happens.
