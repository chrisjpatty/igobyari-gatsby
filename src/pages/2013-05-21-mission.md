  If you are familiar with Mormonism and General Conference, you may remember this announcement from last October:</p> 
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    What was I doing following this announcement? Crying. Like a baby. Even now when I listen to it I cry like a &nbsp;baby. It was incredible.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    My first instinct was this: I really want to go with them right now. I want to join this new wave of missionaries going out to teach the Gospel so badly.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    After two or three days, I started feeling like it probably wasn&#8217;t going to happen. And it was painful to come to that conclusion. Everybody was asking, &#8220;So when are you going to go?&#8221; And I kept having to say, &#8220;Not right now.&#8221;&nbsp;

    After my brother&#8217;s Seminary Graduation on Sunday, I started to wonder.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    I&#8217;m going to be as honest as I can be with you right now: I don&#8217;t know for sure if I will, but starting now, I&#8217;m going to be turning to my Heavenly Father and asking Him if I should serve following my college graduation next spring. I want to serve. We&#8217;ll see what happens.
