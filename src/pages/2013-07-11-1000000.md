<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  People always ask, &#8220;What would you do if you had a million dollars?&#8221; In response, we like to say, &#8220;Oh, help my family, pay for school, travel.&#8221; All of those things are good things. Today, however, I realized an equally important answer to that question.</p> 
  
  <p>
    If I had a million dollars, I would pay for experiences. Not just plane tickets, not just hotels, but <i>experiences</i>. The chance to ride an elephant or skydive or snorkel in the Great Barrier Reef, to stand in the top of the Rotunda and to ride in a hot air balloon. Drop $50s into kids&#8217; lemonade stands and $10,000 in the hands of a homeless man. Who cares where you go. It&#8217;s all about what you do and what the things you do make you become.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d do with a million.&nbsp;
