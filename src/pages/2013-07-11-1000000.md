People always ask, “What would you do if you had a million dollars?” In response, we like to say, “Oh, help my family, pay for school, travel.” All of those things are good things. Today, however, I realized an equally important answer to that question.

If I had a million dollars, I would pay for experiences. Not just plane tickets, not just hotels, but _experiences_. The chance to ride an elephant or skydive or snorkel in the Great Barrier Reef, to stand in the top of the Rotunda and to ride in a hot air balloon. Drop $50s into kids’ lemonade stands and $10,000 in the hands of a homeless man. Who cares where you go. It’s all about what you do and what the things you do make you become.

That’s what I’d do with a million.
