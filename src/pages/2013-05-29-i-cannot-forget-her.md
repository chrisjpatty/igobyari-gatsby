<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  pasty linoleum,<br />fish-eyed fifteen year-olds,<br />cluttered restroom counters,<br />cafeteria milk cartons<br />crunched into Stonehenge<br />monuments through<br />the halls</p> 
  
  <p>
    days in tinsel town<br />when the future<br />was unpredictable<br />but we weren&#8217;t
  </p>
  
  <p>
    you and I weren&#8217;t
  </p>
  
  <p>
    smashing lockers,<br />tears in bathroom stalls,<br />shirts ripped untucked,<br />up-dos after laughed-at<br />attempts to curl my<br />hair on my own,<br />long and angry letters,<br />cold and bitter shoulders,<br />shrinking away into<br />spaceless corners, wherein<br />I prayed you couldn&#8217;t<br />find enough air<br />to say the things<br />you said to me
  </p>
  
  <p>
    making jokes you said<br />you never meant,<br />making jabs you said<br />would make me stronger
  </p>
  
  <p>
    a day after you told me my hair<br />was ugly long,<br />I chopped all of it off<br />and couldn&#8217;t look at myself<br />in the mirror without wanting<br />to cry
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I loved you like a sister<br />because you had great moments,<br />moments that are harder<br />for me to remember
  </p>
  
  <p>
    if you knew how many times<br />I&#8217;ve written about you,<br />how many times you&#8217;ve influenced<br />everything I&#8217;ve ever said<br />and everything I&#8217;ve ever done<br />since then . . .
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;d feel
  </p>
  
  <p>
    grown up, we talk,<br />mostly about what&#8217;s important,<br />we can have a conversation<br />without it ending in a fight now
  </p>
  
  <p>
    but now and again<br />I can see that tone in your sentences,<br />feel my heart tremble,<br />feel myself shrink away<br />because everything comes back
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I catch myself grabbing<br />at my shoulder-length hair<br />and catch tears I<br />didn&#8217;t realize were coming
  </p>
  
  <p>
    the girl you were still haunts me<br />and I cannot forget her</div>
