<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  Apparently you can undelete blogs. Who knew?</p> 
  
  <p>
    After what has been one of the most emotionally exhausting weeks of my life, I deleted my blog. I thought it would be a good idea, because blogs tend to get me into more trouble than they&#8217;re worth. So last night, after a truly agonizing day, I deleted my blog.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Today my emotions had no place to go except inside me, and I was pummeled by them. So I guess what I&#8217;m saying is that blogs are good things.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I don&#8217;t know what God&#8217;s plan for me is right now. I feel stagnant and the melancholy that usually only restricts itself to February has been hovering around me and keeping me from doing what I need to do. I&#8217;m struggling in school and in life and at work. I&#8217;m struggling with myself. Yes, world. Arianna gets insecure, too. Probably more than most people. I&#8217;m awkward and cowardly and so many other things.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I don&#8217;t mean to complain so much on this blog, just to get things off of my chest, but I won&#8217;t lie to you. Right now I&#8217;m struggling immensely.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That&#8217;s why this blog is alive again. Because it needs to be.
