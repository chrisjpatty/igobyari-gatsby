<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  So, my birthday&#8217;s coming up in two days. It&#8217;ll feel like the perfect night to dress up like hipsters and make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh.</p> 
  
  <p>
    Yeah. So I&#8217;m going to be 22! I&#8217;ve been feeling 22 for the past four months. It&#8217;s kind of a boring age, excepting the fact that it has a wildly popular song named after it. Which, for all intents and purposes, is less of a song about birthdays and more of a song about being a poser. I&#8217;ve debated taking my birth date off of Facebook for fear that I&#8217;ll be assaulted by Taylor Swift music videos. No joke. (I&#8217;m sorry, friends. I know some of you are big T-Swift fans, but I just&#8230;I can&#8217;t.)

  <p>
    At any rate, I&#8217;ve done my best to compile a good, alternative list of songs for the 22-year-olds among us in an attempt to keep us all cultured and non-cliche&#8217;. Some of them are about birthdays, some of them are about heartache, some of them really have nothing to do with 22, but whatever.

  <p>
    Here are some anthems for all of you, my 22-year-old friends:

  </div>

    And if none of those fit your fancy, here are the songs I&#8217;ll be jamming out to on <i>my</i> birthday:
