I’ll be honest. Life has seemed pretty aimless for the past few weeks. It’s been kind of hard. I never really expected post-graduation to be this difficult, but it is. 

In Sunday School this week, we talked about goal-setting and direction, and it really gave me pause. What am I doing with my life? I wondered. What _do_ I want to do with my life? What do I want to experience? 

The teacher had us start writing up a list of 100 things we want to accomplish in this lifetime. It’s an exercise that, when you do it, shows you what kind of a person you want to become and what your purpose in life is. It was kind of hard for me to stay at 100, because I have a lot. 

Since I feel like writing it down more than once will reiterate it even more (and since it’s on my blog, it might give me more ownership and accountability), here are 100 things I want to do in my life (in order of how they came to my mind): 

\*Side note: maybe you could help me discover that purpose. 🙂
