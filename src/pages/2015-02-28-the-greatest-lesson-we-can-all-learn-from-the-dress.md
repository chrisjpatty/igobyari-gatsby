    <i>Yes. I am going here.&nbsp;</i>
  </p>

    Twenty four hours ago, I was minding my own business on Twitter when I noticed #TheDress pop on my trending bar. Curious, I clicked on it. Within minutes, the WHOLE INTERNET WAS EXPLODING.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sometimes, when things like this go viral, my stomach gets all angsty feeling and I start breathing thin air and I pace my room and I rant, &#8220;Why can&#8217;t things that actually matter go viral?! This is SO ridiculous. I don&#8217;t understand why people care so much about something so meaningless. WHY? WHY? WHY?!&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But then, I started reading comments. And I laughed at one that was funny. And then I couldn&#8217;t stop laughing. Like, it was 11:00 pm and I went into the kitchen and got a bowl of frosted mini-wheats and glued myself to my computer, nearly choking on mini-wheats, I was laughing so hard.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I learned a valuable lesson from that dress. For one, people are ridiculous. But more importantly:<br /><a name='more'></a><b><i>we take ourselves and life way too seriously.&nbsp;</i></b><br /><b><br /></b>President Hinckley once said, &#8220;Life is to be enjoyed, not just endured.&#8221; Maybe that means that we are allowed to have a big, collective laugh about a freaky dress once in awhile, to take one night of our lives and enjoy the pleasure of something that isn&#8217;t painful or hard, just goofy. Should people care more about the hard things going on in the world? Sure. Is human suffering more important than a dress? Definitely.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But do we have to constantly badger ourselves about all that is bad and not good and falling apart in the world and have a complete meltdown every time something trivial gets popular? Of course not.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Let&#8217;s all try harder to not be so irritated all of the time. It&#8217;s easy to be. I know. As a girl who <i>frequently </i>writes when irritated, I know all too well how easy it is to feed that irritation.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But life is silly and the planet is weird and our brothers and sisters are quirky and fascinating.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Let&#8217;s all just take one big breath of air and lighten up.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Also: the dress is definitely blue and black, no matter what you people say. üòâ
