    Guess what?!

    You heard right. Starting September 8th, I&#8217;ll be writing full-time for LDS Living.

    It&#8217;s an internship, so there&#8217;s no guarantee of permanence, but I&#8217;ll be writing for an income 40 hours a week until December 19th. That&#8217;s insane! It&#8217;s a step and a small dream, a crazy dream, one which stems from this blog and the things that have happened with this blog. It&#8217;s exciting, and I owe you all a huge thank you. Thank you for reading and sharing what I have to write. You&#8217;re incredible.&nbsp;

    So yeah. I&#8217;ll have to move to Salt Lake City (okay, maybe not Salt Lake City, exactly, but where I come from, <i>all </i>of Salt Lake County is considered Salt Lake City), and that&#8217;s a little scary. I&#8217;m definitely a bit of a country bumpkin who likes her space. I mean, what is there to do in Salt Lake City? Do you guys have canyons? Rock walls? Please tell me you have rock walls, or I might cry.

    I&#8217;m going to be thrown into a new ward for awhile. That mildly terrifies me. Have I mentioned that I&#8217;m really bad at meeting new people? </p> 
    
    <p>
      I&#8217;m going to be right near Temple Square <i>all </i>the time, which is amazing!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I&#8217;m going to have to ride Trax, which, let&#8217;s be honest, is the least exciting part of this adventure (once upon a time I went to a One Republic concert with some friends and ended up stranded in SLC due to, among other things, aforementioned Trax).&nbsp;

  <div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

  <div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    I&#8217;m going to be away from my family, my ward, my friends, the grocery store bakery and coworkers I&#8217;ve grown ridiculously fond of. And this blog will go through a bit of a reversion. When I started blogging, I wanted to keep my family posted about my adventures down at BYU. That changed when my plans changed, but it may go back to that for a bit.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    I&#8217;m scared. I mean, I&#8217;m so excited, but I&#8217;m nervous. This is a BIG change for me. I guess I&#8217;ve just got to trust that the Lord knows what He&#8217;s doing and that I belong in Salt Lake City this fall.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    ALSO: I have a new, much smarter phone. Yay! So I&#8217;ll be using Instagram waaaaaay more. You can check that out this way:&nbsp;

      So tell me, Salt Lake City. What do you have in store? I hear Harmons is pretty good.</div> </div>
