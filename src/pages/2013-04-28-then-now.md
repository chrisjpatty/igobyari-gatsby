  <p>
    Then: I complained a lot about bad days and bad weeks.<br />Now: they come less frequently, and when they do, I suck it up so no one knows.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then: all I wanted was for some cute boy to notice me.<br />Now: all I want is to become something great.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then: I did everything everyone else was doing.<br />Now: I dread being a clone.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then: I didn&#8217;t listen to much music.<br />Now: I sometimes feel emotional pain when I have to go a day without it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then: I read books that made me notice what I lacked as a girl.<br />Now: I read books that mentally and spiritually fulfill me.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then: I got really lonely.<br />Now: being alone affords me some of the greatest moments of my life.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then: I wanted to write books and get famous.<br />Now: I want to write something that changes a life.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then: I found a lot of people in my life uncomfortable and too awkward to associate with.<br />Now: I realize the importance of treating every person like a friend.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then: I thought feminism and celebration of womanhood was terrible.<br />Now: I still think feminism is kind of terrible, but hope to be able to celebrate womanhood every day.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then: I said stuff like, &#8220;Obama is a communistic, socialist Muslim! Everyone knows it!&#8221;<br />Now: I say stuff like, &#8220;Obama is a scapegoat! If all of these Tea Party crackpots would just shut up for a moment, they&#8217;d realize that<i> they&#8217;re</i> the problem.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then: I took pains to share every detail that wasn&#8217;t really important.<br />Now: realizing how little people tend to care, I take care to share what I feel is important.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then: I wanted to grow up and be a vinyl sticker, mini-van, Pinterest addicted mom.<br />Now: I want to raise children who are well-educated, kind, and different.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then: I thought God was real.<br />Now: I know He is.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then: I had no interest in politics.<br />Now: voting and being knowledgeable about what happens in the country is&nbsp;<i>crucial</i>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then: I thought that my generation was the problem.<br />Now: I see what parents allow their kids to do these days and blame everything on those who are older.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then: I thought I would die if school didn&#8217;t end soon.<br />Now: I don&#8217;t want school to end. At all. I want to keep learning.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then: I was naive.<br />Now: I know too much.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then: I was just another girl.<br />Now: I&#8217;m Arianna, and I mean something. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here.
