  Well, I did expect the wave of &#8220;what have I done&#8221; to hit me hard eventually. As much as I feel great for sharing what I&#8217;ve been through with shyness and for reading your reactions to it, I feel physically and emotionally exhausted from the attention. Like, I just want to hide in a hole and pretend it didn&#8217;t happen. Silly introversion.</p>

    This is the song I listened to in junior high to help me keep my chin up.<br /><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F55815388" width="100%"></iframe> I was trying to find Death&#8217;s Song on Soundcloud, but this is pretty good, too.<br /><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F82765307" width="100%"></iframe> I wish I could find the real deal, but this works. The instrumentals are beautiful, and his voice is slightly breathy and soothing.<br /><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F38548964" width="100%"></iframe> I love this song. So glad I found it.<br /><iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F90149704" width="100%"></iframe> I haven&#8217;t listened to a Death Cab song until recently, and I really like them. Particularly this one:&nbsp;<iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F2713403" width="100%"></iframe><br />Another good alternative tune.&nbsp;<iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F72431853" width="100%"></iframe><br />I like this one a lot. It&#8217;s different, but good.&nbsp;<iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F98393043" width="100%"></iframe><br />Another lovely voice.&nbsp;<iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F22655869" width="100%"></iframe>
