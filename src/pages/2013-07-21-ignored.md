<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  On Friday I ended up getting caught in the middle of a political discussion two male polisci majors were having. I was super excited, and I tried my best to get involved, but they shut me down and ignored me so fast. Is it just because I&#8217;m a girl and guys think girls don&#8217;t care and don&#8217;t have good input on that kind of stuff? Huh? Because if so, I am freaking steamed.</p>
