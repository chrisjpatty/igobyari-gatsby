<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  1. I get <i>really </i>grumpy when I&#8217;m reading a good book and someone interrupts me. The only other emotional equivalent to interruption while reading is being cut off while driving. It makes me ridiculously angry.*</p> 
  
  <p>
    2. When I&#8217;m reading a book, I must <i>always </i>stop reading at the end of the chapter. None of this ending in the middle nonsense. Of course, the danger with stopping at chapter&#8217;s end is that chapter&#8217;s end is when all of the twists happen, and then I end up reading at least two or three other chapters to find out what happens.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    3. I NEVER dog-ear my books. Ever. It&#8217;s despicable. Sometimes I leave them upside down and spread eagle with their spines in the air, but even that&#8217;s rare. Book bones can only hold out for so long.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    4. If I&#8217;m going to reread a book, it had better be well-worth me rereading it. There are way too many books in the world to read, and rereading is an insanely wasteful thing to do if the book&#8217;s not good enough. The only books I have ever reread are: The Harry Potter Series (I&#8217;ve only read them, like, 2-3 times), The Inheritance Cycle (because after five years of Chris Paolini doing nothing between books, I forgot everything), Great Expectations (because it&#8217;s worth it), and The Book of Mormon (which I have reread 4-5 times).
  </p>
  
  <p>
    5. I do NOT write in a book unless it&#8217;s so tragically boring that I need to spice things up (ex: The Faerie Queene by Spenser). OR: if it&#8217;s for a class. But I did that for my Dickens class for a little bit, and it almost killed me. Writing is so distracting in a novel. Ugh.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    6. I often carry a book with me to my various appointments on the slim chance that I will have time to read it. I never do, but it&#8217;s comforting to know that I have a companion anyway.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    7. Getting books in the mail is THE GREATEST thing you could ever experience. I&#8217;ve switched from buying books in stores to getting them from Amazon.com, and it is insanely fun to have nice packages land on my doorstep.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8. If a book gets wildly popular, I usually read it once then back off. Take for example The Hunger Games series. I loved it immensely, but since it&#8217;s gotten popular, I have not reread it. I just have to keep repeating to myself, &#8220;I am not my fandom. I am not my fandom. I am not my stupid, immature, surface-reading, preteen fandom.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9. I buy books just to see how good they look on my shelf. True story.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    10. Walking into libraries/bookstores often gives me headaches because I am so overwhelmed by how much there is to read. Another true story.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    11. The only time I can stay up until 3-4 in the morning, guilt-free, is when I&#8217;m reading a good book. It is so worth it.
