      If you have not yet watched this trailer, I don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;s possible that you are human. Seriously. Are you even breathing right now? WATCH IT. IMMEDIATELY.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To be fair, it was wedged in the middle of some football game on ESPN and then crept onto the Internet like a Sith in cashmere socks, so I could almost excuse your oversight. Except that this is Star Wars we&#8217;re talking about and practically the most important thing in the entire universe right now, nbd.<br /><i><br /></i>The final trailer of Star Wars: Episode VII is here! IT&#8217;S HEEEEEERRRREEE. That means the film comes out in two months. That means I&#8217;m so excited, I could explode. Like Alderaan, may it rest in peace.
    </p>

      <a name='more'></a>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      First: John Williams&#8217; music is STUNNING. Tears were almost shed when I heard &#8220;Han Solo and the Princess&#8221; reprised. The man is unmatched.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Second: Are we never going to talk about the fact that John Boyega is a black guy playing a clone? This trailer makes it seem like he&#8217;s been a clone his whole life. HOW. I love him, but how? Did the Empire have a backup template in case all five billion Jango Fetts turned out to be duds? It is obvious that Jango couldn&#8217;t aim, as we all know. So maybe.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Third: Kylo Ren. He shouldn&#8217;t talk. Ever. He doesn&#8217;t sound like a Sith apprentice rising from the ashes of the Vader regime. He sounds like Kevin McCallister reserving a hotel room with his dad&#8217;s credit card.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Fourth: Rey is Han and Leia&#8217;s daughter, she has the Force, and it&#8217;s inevitable that she&#8217;s going to use a lightsaber at some point. #IMHO
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Fifth: Isn&#8217;t old Harrison Ford just so endearing?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Sixth:&nbsp;What&#8217;s up with Kylo Ren&#8217;s zombie army at minute 1:24? Who is this freak?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Seventh: If you don&#8217;t love all of this TIE fighter/X-Wing drama, you are an android with no human feelings. Period. You need to go home and rethink your life.
    </p>

    </div>
    
    <p>
      Eighth: There is so much poetry in an older Han admitting what a younger Han would not believe, that the Force is real. Gospel analogies abound right there.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Ninth: I desperately, DESPERATELY want to see more of the chrome trooper. Make this a thing, J.J.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Tenth: Rey and Finn are going to be a thing, unless that rebel pilot with the luscious locks swoops in and ruins that, which will probably happen.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Eleventh: Luke is a dead man. Like, seriously. He&#8217;s either dead or he&#8217;s holed up in a hut somewhere like Obi Wan. He&#8217;s not on the posters, he&#8217;s not in the trailer. Why does Leia look sad? He&#8217;s dead. Start your grieving now before you get caught off guard later. He is dead. Either that or he&#8217;s Kylo Ren. What a plot twist that would be.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Twelfth: They pack that trailer with so much stuff that you almost forget about the fact that Finn is going up against Kylo Ren with a lightsaber. Woefully outmatched? Or secretly an underdog? Only time will tell. Speaking of time,
