<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  So my friend took her playlist, put it on shuffle, and used the first lines of each song to form a poem. I&#8217;m stealing her idea. Here&#8217;s the monstrosity I&#8217;ve created with my own favorites list:</p> 
  
  <div>
    It&#8217;s been so long, I&#8217;ve been out of my body with you&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    You know I said it&#8217;s true
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I&#8217;m waking up to ash and dust&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Try to hear my voice&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Slow hard, dog, wait, down love, black canvas&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I&#8217;m coming up only to hold you under&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I&#8217;m waking up to ash and dust&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    East London&#8217;s not a bomb site&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Welcome to your life&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Oh I just wanna take you anywhere that you like&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I don&#8217;t like walking around this old and empty house&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I was supposed to do great things&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I had a dream so big and loud&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    You&#8217;re killing me, kid&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Whatever you do, I do it, too&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Here we are with our backs against the wall&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    When life leaves you high and dry&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    You&#8217;ll never feel happy&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Roll away your stone, I&#8217;ll roll away mine&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    It doesn&#8217;t hurt me&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Easing out, with my heart&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Well I woke up to the sound of silence&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Some saw the sun, some saw the smoke&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Hope when you take that jump, you don&#8217;t feel the fall&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I am my mother&#8217;s only one&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Pretty girls come from the ugliest places&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I&#8217;m waking up to ash and dust&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I know the time has numbered my days&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I&#8217;ve seen the world, done it all, had my cake now&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I&#8217;ll keep you safe.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>

    <i>I apparently have at least three variations of </i>Radioactive <i>on my playlist. Who knew?&nbsp;</i>
