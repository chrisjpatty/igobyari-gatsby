Today in combined Relief Society/Elders’, we had a chat about new year’s resolutions, and I got to feeling reeeaaal guilty about mine for 2013. I don’t think I wrote them anywhere besides my last blog, which I deleted from the Internet after what we’ll call a horrible miscommunication in regards to a post I wrote about dating. You wonder why I don’t write about it much. Yeaah…

Anyway, I decided to look back at my resolutions. And I am embarrassed. Maybe I put too much on my plate. Maybe I should just be resolved to not keep any of my resolutions, which, if kept, will make me a liar and which, if not kept, will still mean that I didn’t keep my resolution to not keep my resolutions, which means I’m still a liar. At any rate, let’s see how I’ve done.

**1\. Attend the temple on a consistent schedule each month — **This is what I’d like to call a loaded resolution. I did get to going once a week for awhile on the same day, but then I slept in and decided, _Meh. If I don’t just go on, say, Wednesdays, I’ll at least go some other time during the week_. And right now, I’ve done a poor job. I have gotten into the temple at least once a month the whole year, however, and that is an accomplishment to me.  
**Resolution Status: basically kept. **

**2\. Read 50 books** — According to Goodreads, which sometimes lies to make me feel like more of a failure, I only read 21 books this year. Not even half. Last year I read 42. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME?! THAT’S NOT EVEN TWO BOOKS A MONTH. \*dies\* I still have two days left to stuff myself full of literature.  
**Resolution Status: less than half kept. **  

**3\. Finish Redd, the novel I started last year —** Um, I started it a little more. Does that count?  
**Resolution Status: not kept. **  

**4\. Make a habit of doing yoga every day** — This will likely be my resolution until the end of time.  
**Resolution Status: not kept for the second to third year in a row. **  

**5\. Work up to the point where I can climb 5.10 + walls** — I climbed a lot this summer, but the best I can do is a 5.8. I’m almost there.  
**Resolution Status: trying. **  

**6\. Hike Flat Top — finally!** — NEVAH!  
**Resolution Status: not kept for fourth year in a row. **  

**7\. Find one project to get behind that will help dozens, maybe even hundreds, of people** — This is vague and I’m not sure I know what project we’re talking about. Can we count Institute? My stake service projects? Signing the “I Stand with Phil Robertson” petition?  
**Resolution Status: kept. For sure. **  

**8\. Read the Lord of the Rings series** — I read _The Hobbit_, which, as many pseudo and genuine Tolkein-obsessees would say: “DOESN’T COUNT!” I have started _The Fellowship_, though, so I’m well on my way to starting this resolution by the time it’s too late. Yay for me.  
**Resolution Status: not kept. **  

**9\. Get an internship** — KEPT! Almost twice, as I almost chose to have two internships this semester. It’s probably a good thing that didn’t work out.  
**Resolution Status: KEPT.**  

**10\. Eat at Chili’s for the first time** — Alas, my lips may never taste the heavenly goodness of a lava cake for years to come. I’m too unmotivated and too broke.  
**Resolution Status: not kept. **  

**11\. Make a galaxy print scarf** — I forgot that I wanted to do this.  
**Resolution Status: not kept. **  

**12\. Find a quiet place to think/write** — This is an odd one. So far, the best I’ve been able to find is in the Institute Council room and Institute library, neither of which I have used properly to think or write or in quiet. So…yes, but no.  
**Resolution Status: technically kept. **  

**13\. Make a writing schedule for myself** — I am an embarrassment to my chosen field.  
**Resolution Status: definitely not kept. **  

**14\. Read scriptures at least 15 minutes a day** — At the beginning of the year, I was awesome. And then, I got less and less awesome.  
**Resolution Status: kept then not kept. **  

**15\. Finish This is the Christ** — Um…coughcoughstartthisisthechristcough.  
**Resolution Status: coughforgottenaboutcough**  

**16\. Get published somewhere** — SUCCESS! I had my graphic skills published on a book cover. Not the publication medium I had planned on, but still publication!  
**Resolution Status: kept. **  

**17\. Build a stronger relationship with my brothers** — With all seriousness, I think I can say that I kept this one. It isn’t a perfect relationship, by any means, but it is a much healthier one than that of a few years ago.  
**Resolution Status: kept. **

**18\. Manage fear** — I guess you could say I’ve learned how to manage fear, but not entirely. Overcoming it is what I need to work on.  
**Resolution Status: kept. Sorta. **  
So I guess it’s:  
**Resolutions: 11**  
**Ari: 7 **  
Here’s to hoping next year I’ll be more motivated. And finally eat my lava cake after a morning of intense warrior poses.
