Write. A TON.  
Explore Green Canyon a little more.  
Go climbing. Praise the heavens.  
Read whatever books I want! YEEEEAH.  
Sleep outside in a makeshift tent.  
Reupholster my desk chair and spruce up my desk with some spray paint.  
Learn how to longboard.  
Learn Spanish — maybe.  
Hike up Logan River.  
Climb up the 420 tower.  
Have dance parties.  
Watch movies outside.  
Take more photos.  
Sing more songs.  
Live again.
