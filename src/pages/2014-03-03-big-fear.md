  <i>What are you afraid of?</i>&nbsp;</p> 
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    My answer to this question has evolved several times throughout my life. In elementary school, I would have said getting called on in class. In high school, I would have said leaving all of my friends behind. As a freshman in college, my answer was the future. And as I&#8217;ve gone to school and grown into a woman, that answer has been sort of elusive, found in quite a few things.&nbsp;

    <i>Being on the KissCam.&nbsp;</i>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <i>Heartbreak.</i>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <i>Graduation. &nbsp;</i>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <i>Vulnerability.</i>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <i>Singing karaoke. &nbsp;</i>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <i>Pain.&nbsp;</i>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <i>Being alone.&nbsp;</i>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <i>Failure.&nbsp;</i>
  </div>

    With a little more clarity now, I think the thing I fear the most is that I am not and will never be enough. I worry that I&#8217;ll never be enough for a future employer, that I&#8217;ll never be enough as a student; I worry that I&#8217;ll never be enough in the callings I&#8217;ve been given, and that I&#8217;ll never be enough to the men I date. &nbsp;

    I am a perfectionist living inside of a body and a heart and a mind that are far from perfect. And I am so cruel sometimes.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <i>You didn&#8217;t get the job because you&#8217;re not good enough of a speaker, Ari.</i>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <i>You didn&#8217;t get the grade because you didn&#8217;t do enough work.&nbsp;</i>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <i>You&#8217;re not magnifying your calling like you should be; you&#8217;re not doing enough.&nbsp;</i>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <i>He stopped dating you because you weren&#8217;t smart, beautiful, fun, or good enough.&nbsp;</i>
  </div>

    Everyone falls short at some point, but for me, falling short is incredibly and personally painful. I don&#8217;t know how to compensate for shortcomings like I should, and a lot of times, I feel like I&#8217;m to blame for them. &nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    How does a person become &#8220;enough&#8221;? How can you apply the Atonement in a way that gives you no doubt that, yes, you are enough?&nbsp;
  </div>

  </div>
  
  <div>
    I think I know, but when I have to ask myself the same questions, I wonder.&nbsp;
