    Usually, I&#8217;m all over the New Year&#8217;s Eve stuff. I&#8217;ll write long lists of what I accomplished in the past year, do a review on my blog, and think of all of my worst moments and mentally let them go in the seconds counting down to midnight. One year, I spent the last hour of my New Year&#8217;s Eve writing a page filled with close to 100 resolutions. Can&#8217;t say I wasn&#8217;t ambitious, right? This year was a little bit different, however. I partied hard, slept in harder, and woke up with the realization that I hadn&#8217;t done a thing to prepare for the new year. Not only that, but I woke up with the horror of realizing that the last song I listened to in 2015 was &#8220;Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae).&#8221; Oh heavens. Please forgive me, better than the average human&#8217;s musical tastes. (That was a subtle and accurate, though arrogant, nod to the quality of my Spotify playlists, in case you&#8217;re interested.)</p>

      All of that being said, new years are important to me. I&#8217;m a significantly imperfect person, and it always feels refreshing to have a symbolic chance to start over and be better, to let go of all of the things that were sad or hard the year before and try again. I&#8217;ve thought long and hard about what I want the theme of my year to be, and the three words I always come back to are authentic, open, and brave. I want to be open with others and myself, honest about who I am, confident and unafraid. I went through a period as a teenager where I hated and struggled with who I was. There were few things I liked about myself, and when I didn&#8217;t get validation from people I looked up to, I caged myself in and hid both the worst and best parts of myself. I was terrified of being laughed at or rejected for who I was, so I forced myself to be emotionless and personalityless. It&#8217;s taken years to undo the damage that caused. I still have to work on not hiding myself every day.

      At the end of 2016, I want to be able to say that that is completely behind me and that I am unashamedly me, authentic with whomever I&#8217;m with and more afraid of hiding who I am than losing the good opinions of other people.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      I am imperfect and weak and funny and smart and my hair is pretty okay and I can be fun to be around when I stop worrying about what other people think. Here&#8217;s to a year when I can fully embrace all of that.
