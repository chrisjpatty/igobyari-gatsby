<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  1. I have THE BIGGEST crush on Han Solo-era Harrison Ford.<br />2. When I&#8217;m putting salt and pepper on my food, I <i>always </i>have to put salt on before pepper, otherwise I get anxiety.<br />3. Most girls love cheesecake. To me, it&#8217;s mediocre.<br />4. If a guy can wear and rock skinny jeans, my attraction to him increases by at <i>least </i>50%.<br />5. I&#8217;m sort of addicted to Dr. Phil. <br />6. I&#8217;m substantially more picky about who I rock climb with than who I go out with.<br />7. Sometimes I get road rage, and the only thing that calms me down is making up songs about the other driver&#8217;s traffic faux pas (Example from yesterday: &#8220;It was my turn / when you gonna learn / what the roundabout / is all about?&#8221;)<br />8. In high school/college, my worst dreams were about failing all my classes or showing up late. Now my worst dreams are about my friends going on adventures without telling me.<br />9. I cried so hard during the last Harry Potter movie premiere that I left with a migraine.<br />10. Whenever it rains, I put on music from the 1950s.<br />11. Sometimes I try speaking in different Star Wars languages (Ewok, Tusken Raider, the language of the Hutts, etc.). But only in privileged company.<br />12. I own a didgeridoo. For real.<br />13. I don&#8217;t do routine well and HAVE to have variety, or I go crazy.<br />14. When I&#8217;m bored, I organize everything with the precision of an obsessive-compulsive. At work two days ago, for example, I was bagging artisan bread in alphabetical order according to flavor.<br />15. I get <i>really </i>competitive when I watch Jeopardy. Those nerds are going DOWN.<br />16. The older I get, the less I hate cats. And the more I want to purchase one.<br />17. Ice cream trucks scare the living daylights out of me.<br />18. Misplaced apostrophes (or the lack of apostrophes) in a business&#8217;s name, flyers, or card information make me much less likely to shop there. I&#8217;m not even lying.<br />19. The idea of living in New York City both enchants and terrifies me.<br />20. As a junior in college, I was addicted to watching My Little Pony. I&#8217;ve been clean for about a year now.</p>

    <a name='more'></a><br />21. J.K. Rowling is THE reason why I&#8217;m a writer. Insult Harry Potter and you&#8217;re basically insulting my soul.<br />22. I drive a black Honda Civic with blue rims and interior lighting. It&#8217;s a beast.<br />23. I go all <i>Lord of the Flies</i> over my space when it comes to beach-going, camping, or attending parades/fireworks. I need space, people.<br />24. When I was little, I wanted to be an astronaut and a veterinarian. Maybe a space veterinarian.<br />25. I <i>really </i>hope that Nessie exists.<br />26. Hats cut off the circulation in my head, so I usually don&#8217;t wear them.<br />27. I sometimes dance to Shakira music in my bedroom.<br />28. My favorite book that I own is Joy of Cooking, but I&#8217;ve never cooked anything out of it once.<br />29. I don&#8217;t really love Doctor Who until I&#8217;m in the middle of watching it. Then I can&#8217;t get enough.<br />30. Most of the time I fake disinterest when I&#8217;m interested in a guy, which is quite problematic, because I also act disinterested when I&#8217;m legitimately disinterested.<br />31. I really want to name my children after literary characters when I&#8217;m a parent.<br />32. I laughed so hard that I was sobbing when I first read Mark Twain&#8217;s &#8220;How I Edited an Agricultural Paper&#8221; essay. To this day, I don&#8217;t understand why it was so funny to me back then.<br />33. Abish is my Book of Mormon hero.<br />34. I want to see every Audrey Hepburn film before I die.<br />35. Sometimes I request invites to the receptions of acquaintances that I barely know just so that I can see how they designed their invites. And if their photos look good. Yeeaah. I&#8217;m not too proud about that.<br />36. I&#8217;m a sucker for a good font.<br />37. One day I want to see the stars from Yosemite. Or anywhere where I can actually <i>see </i>the stars, when they&#8217;re completely exposed in a night sky empty of light pollution.<br />38. Shopping in the grocery store together is on my top ten list of best date ideas.<br />39. I really want to cage dive with great whites, but I&#8217;m pretty certain I&#8217;d break out in nervous sweat and puke everywhere.<br />40. Asphalt right after rain, pine trees, horse hide, and fresh-baked bread are THE BEST smells in the world.<br />41. I&#8217;ve watched the Kiera Knightley Pride and Prejudice at least 20 times. It&#8217;s not really my favorite movie, but I often say it is because it&#8217;s the only one I&#8217;ve watched so often, and I don&#8217;t really have a good excuse for it.<br />42. My text tone is the sound of a TIE fighter.<br />43. I usually listen to a movie&#8217;s soundtrack before I ever see the movie.<br />44. Whenever I write poetry, it&#8217;s a great indicator that I&#8217;m in a lousy mood.<br />45. Cherries are satanic little demon fruits.<br />46. In the summertime, I get freckles on my nose.<br />47. I was that kid who ate Play Dough all the time, in spite of the fact that it really tasted disgusting.<br />48. If there&#8217;s a tall tree anywhere near me, I&#8217;ll most likely attempt to climb it.<br />49. I know how to oil paint.<br />50. I stopped going to the library when I realized that I own at least 150 books that I have not read yet. My bookshelf <i>is </i>a library.<br />51. I didn&#8217;t know anything about Nelson Mandela when he died. After taking a South African literature class, I deeply regret that, because I feel like he was and is one of the last great heroes of our day.<br />52. Nail polish is the enemy. Unless it&#8217;s on my toes, then it&#8217;s cool.<br />53. If it was socially acceptable, I&#8217;d walk barefoot everywhere.<br />54. I can barely swim to save my life, but I love being in water.<br />55. The bus driver had to drag me off the bus when I started Kindergarten because I was so terrified.<br />56. Whenever someone says &#8220;dumber than a box of rocks&#8221; or &#8220;as dull as a rock,&#8221; I get defensive, because I&#8217;m obsessed with rocks.<br />57. One day I want to have a novel sitting on the shelf at Walmart.<br />58. Volcanoes horrify me. <br />59. &#8220;Welcome Home, Son&#8221; by Radical Face is the song that haunts my life and my relationships.<br />60. If I could play any musical instrument, I&#8217;d probably play the harp.<br />61. I still watch Arthur sometimes.<br />62. Some people are known for &#8220;their (insert amazing food item here).&#8221; For me, those food items are gingersnaps, ribs, and chocolate cake.<br />63. Walmart trips stress me out until I realize that I can use a self-checkout. Then I&#8217;m totally fine.<br />64. I get asked all of the time if my eyes are so blue because I wear colored contact lenses. I wear contacts, but these peepers are the real thing.

    65. Once upon a time, I learned the choreography for &#8220;What Does the Fox Say?&#8221; Do not ask me to perform for you.<br />66. Fall is my favorite season.<br />67. One of my biggest regrets from childhood is that I didn&#8217;t continue taking dance and piano lessons.<br />68. Camels are freaking adorable to me.<br />69. It&#8217;s super hard to surprise me, but fairly easy to scare me.<br />70. I really, really want to adopt a dog from the Humane Society.<br />71. Part of me thinks that diamond engagement rings are super cliche&#8217;, and there&#8217;s a raging debate inside my head about whether I&#8217;d want a diamond ring or not.<br />72. I do a lot of my clothes shopping at the D.I. Try it sometime.<br />73. The feel of chalk or flour on my hands is the best feeling in the world to me.<br />74. My nightmare is to turn into one of those &#8220;hip&#8221; Mormon wives who wears chevron all the time, stencils her entire house, and watches The Bachelor for fun.<br />75. I never usually read a book more than once. Most of my favorite books I&#8217;ve only read once.<br />76. I used to be a journalist, and I get super ticked off when I watch the news because ethical journalism is becoming a thing of the past.<br />77. Dating/relationships scare me more than I&#8217;d admit.<br />78. I once wrote over 50,000 words in one month. I have not reread them for fear of what I&#8217;ll find.<br />79. More than a few times, I&#8217;ve been tempted to wear men&#8217;s cologne because some of it smells sooooo good.<br />80. I&#8217;m not too shabby at tennis.<br />81. When it comes to food, the more exciting and different, the better. I&#8217;m not really a hamburger type of girl.<br />82. I can eat sushi like it&#8217;s cereal most days.<br />83. Every Wednesday, I get the blogging bug, but then I don&#8217;t because I can&#8217;t think of a good enough alliterative phrase to theme my posts around. (Weird Wednesday?)<br />84. Studio C is my favorite thing in the whole world (as is BalloonShop on YouTube). Look &#8217;em up.<br />85. I&#8217;m not good at any winter sports, and as a general rule, hate winter because all of my hobbies seem to center around the summertime.<br />86. Small talk is hard for me, but start talking about big, important events or concepts, and I might not shut up.<br />87. Two years ago, I was in the Hill Cumorah Pageant. It was the among the greatest experiences of my life.

    88. I&#8217;ll always love The Beatles, because that&#8217;s what my dad listened to as I grew up.<br />89. I was that &#8220;painfully shy&#8221; kid nobody knew in junior high. Being shy has been such a huge, defining thing in my life, and without those 13 years dealing with it, I probably wouldn&#8217;t be blogging right now.<br />90. Right now I&#8217;m in the Relief Society presidency.<br />91. One of my biggest pet peeves is when people walk slow.<br />92. The thing that surprised me most about college was that it was the experience rather than the education that changed who I am as a person.<br />93. Rootbeer milk is the bomb.<br />94. My Myers-Briggs result is an INTP.&nbsp;

  <div style="text-align: left;">
    95. Whenever I have to drive through snow in the winter, my go-to calm down song is &#8220;How Firm a Foundation.&#8221;<br />96. I love getting letters in the mail, but I&#8217;m really bad at writing them.<br />97. I can only enjoy eating donuts on days when I don&#8217;t work.<br />98. When I was applying for colleges, my mom had to drag me to Utah State because I hated it so much and completely discounted it as an option.<br />99. I&#8217;m probably one of the most awkward individuals you&#8217;ll ever meet.<br />100. I&#8217;d rather spend money on adventures than possessions.&nbsp;
