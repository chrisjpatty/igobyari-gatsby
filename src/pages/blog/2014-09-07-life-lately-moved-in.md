  Hello! Ari here, blogging from a phone. I hope the layout&#8217;s not too bad because I&#8217;m super OCD about that stuff.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Anyway, I&#8217;m gone away. Moved. I haven&#8217;t had a whole lot of time to settle as I&#8217;ve spent the last three days checking out Comic Con. Which, by the way, was super overwhelming. (I don&#8217;t want to be in another crowd of people for at least a month.) I&#8217;m introverted enough that being in big crowds for too long exhausts me physically, mentally, and emotionally. Right now I&#8217;m in recovery mode.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  So anyway, this blog may be different for awhile. I&#8217;m going back to my blogging roots, when blogging was what I did to stay in touch with family and friends. Since I&#8217;ll be writing full time, I&#8217;m not sure what kind of attention this blog will get. I realize that a lot of you only read for my Gospel stuff, and that&#8217;s great. Things just may be a bit more personal for a bit. That&#8217;s all. Stick around. Get to know me. I&#8217;m kind of cool. Kind of.
</p>

  My first real impression of city life is that it&#8217;s lonely. It&#8217;s funny that a city so large has so little space to speak with people&#8211;they&#8217;re always coming or going. Each morning is punctuated by the whistling exhale of incoming and outgoing trains, the only breath the city seems to take. I feel so small in it.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  On the other hand, this is all one exciting adventure. It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m in an Austen novel, living with my aunt and, tonight, dining with my bishop, who kindly invited us over. Except there aren&#8217;t any petticoats, there are pencil skirts. There are not carriages, there are railroad tracks. And the future is one big, fluctuating thing, not decided. I think that makes me the most anxious.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  But it&#8217;s life and it moves. I&#8217;ll keep you posted.
