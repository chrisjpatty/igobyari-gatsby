Hello! Ari here, blogging from a phone. I hope the layout’s not too bad because I’m super OCD about that stuff.

Anyway, I’m gone away. Moved. I haven’t had a whole lot of time to settle as I’ve spent the last three days checking out Comic Con. Which, by the way, was super overwhelming. (I don’t want to be in another crowd of people for at least a month.) I’m introverted enough that being in big crowds for too long exhausts me physically, mentally, and emotionally. Right now I’m in recovery mode.

So anyway, this blog may be different for awhile. I’m going back to my blogging roots, when blogging was what I did to stay in touch with family and friends. Since I’ll be writing full time, I’m not sure what kind of attention this blog will get. I realize that a lot of you only read for my Gospel stuff, and that’s great. Things just may be a bit more personal for a bit. That’s all. Stick around. Get to know me. I’m kind of cool. Kind of.

My first real impression of city life is that it’s lonely. It’s funny that a city so large has so little space to speak with people–they’re always coming or going. Each morning is punctuated by the whistling exhale of incoming and outgoing trains, the only breath the city seems to take. I feel so small in it.

On the other hand, this is all one exciting adventure. It’s like I’m in an Austen novel, living with my aunt and, tonight, dining with my bishop, who kindly invited us over. Except there aren’t any petticoats, there are pencil skirts. There are not carriages, there are railroad tracks. And the future is one big, fluctuating thing, not decided. I think that makes me the most anxious.

But it’s life and it moves. I’ll keep you posted.
