On Friday I ended up getting caught in the middle of a political discussion two male polisci majors were having. I was super excited, and I tried my best to get involved, but they shut me down and ignored me so fast. Is it just because I’m a girl and guys think girls don’t care and don’t have good input on that kind of stuff? Huh? Because if so, I am freaking steamed.
