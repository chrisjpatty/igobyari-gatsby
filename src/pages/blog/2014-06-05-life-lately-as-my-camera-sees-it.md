      Aside from working, working, working, looking for a career, working, working, and working, post-college life isn&#8217;t so bad. I still have no idea what I&#8217;m going to do with my life, and that&#8217;s mildly terrifying, but sometimes you&#8217;ve just got to hang on to the little moments anyway.

    <p>
      Here are a few of those moments from the past month, brought to you by my little friend, Point &#8216;n&#8217; Shoot:

      ^Chaco tan! My go-to tan of choice, leftover from a rocky tubing adventure in Idaho on Memorial Day. Also: I painted my toenails. I have no idea why. I actually really hate wearing nail polish, but that&#8217;s another post for another day.&nbsp;

      ^Last night I went on my second outdoor climb of the summer with the sis and a couple of friends. We were hoping to have the Fucoidal Walls all to ourselves, but it was kind of a hopping place, which I have major mixed feelings about. I get a little cranky when I have to climb around other groups of people. I&#8217;m just weird like that.&nbsp;

      ^Climbing Jam Crack. Or Community Effort. I don&#8217;t actually know which route, but it had some sweet crack action, which was fun.&nbsp;

      ^Rope burn. Got this baby while lead climbing. I was super stiff and did a practice fall and my left ankle ended up twisting completely around beneath the rope. I was hanging upside down with a backwards foot for a few seconds there. The rope and rock just bit right into my leg. Good times.&nbsp;

      ^More climbing. Also: mini rant. We were climbing around some people who commandeered almost the entire area by stringing ropes and leaving gear on routes that they would hop to and from. Don&#8217;t be that climber. There&#8217;s a special place in you-know-where for that climber.&nbsp;

      ^This is my &#8220;Running Sucks&#8221; face. My ward did an Amazing Race activity, and I chose to run. Which was stupid. I don&#8217;t understand how/why people do this to themselves. I did shovel down some baby food like a beast, though.&nbsp;

      ^ Yesterday, I went on a me date. Went and got sushi and then bought a ticket to see Maleficent by myself. Socially acceptable? No. Do I care? No. Seeing movies in the theater by yourself is AMAZING. But yeah. I saw Maleficent. Did you guys like that movie? I found myself liking it but simultaneously getting really ticked off by it. Or Disney, specifically. For multiple reasons. I also may or may not have eaten sushi with my bare hands in the theater. Yep.</p>
