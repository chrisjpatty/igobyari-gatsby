<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  My blog&#8217;s probably pretty strange to read. I throw a lot of random stuff on it. Most of the time I don&#8217;t even blog about how my life is going. Is that what people usually like reading? I kind of stopped doing that some time ago. Huh.&nbsp;</p> 
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Um . . . okay. I&#8217;m going to try to blog like a normal human being again. Life updates! Those are always nice for friends and family. Here are updates on the different aspects of my life:&nbsp;
  </div>

    <b>Work:&nbsp;</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    If you knew the story of how I got my job at the bakery, you&#8217;d know that I never in five billion years thought I&#8217;d be working in a bakery. It was kind of a happy accident &#8212; ask me about it, if you&#8217;re curious. It&#8217;s been such a blessing, though. I get to work with delicious food, meet fantastic people, and sometimes I decorate cakes. Which is terrifying. But fulfilling. I&#8217;m working much more than I was during the school year, and sometimes that can be exhausting, but nothing feels as great as having responsibility. Plus, coughcough, some of the produce guys are pretty coughcoughattractivecough, and I coughcoughadmirefromafarcough. So that&#8217;s a bonus, I suppose. [:&nbsp;

    <b>Internship:&nbsp;</b><br />As some of you know, I&#8217;ve been interning for a student anthology called &#8220;Voices: On Stage and In Print.&#8221; Right now I&#8217;m designing covers, and I am so, so excited. Publication is my baby. More so than writing in many ways.&nbsp;

    <b>Play:&nbsp;</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    As you can see from my excessive amounts of photos, my sister and I have been doing some climbing. Ugh. You guys, you don&#8217;t even understand how good it feels to grab a rock wall and make your way up it. Not a plastic wall, but a real rock wall. It isn&#8217;t built to trick or trap you. It&#8217;s just naturally challenging, and it&#8217;s <i>a-mazing. </i>Plus, rocks are so beautiful.&nbsp;
  </div>

  <div>
    Aside from rocks, Kori and I are going to Imagine Dragons in FOUR DAYS. AHHHH! Holy smokes. Stoked.&nbsp;

    <b>Living:&nbsp;</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    News flash: I will not be living on campus this year. I decided that I can do just fine at home again. However, I will be moving out next year when I don&#8217;t have so many things to pay for. Hopefully. [:&nbsp;

    <b>Reading:&nbsp;</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I have been reading up a storm, guys. Once summer begins, I have major catching up to do. Right now I&#8217;m simultaneously reading <u>Counseling with our Councils</u><i>,&nbsp;</i><u>The Golden Compass</u>, and I will soon be beginning <u>Ender&#8217;s Game</u><i><u>.</u>&nbsp;</i>I hope to be able to read <u>Little Dorrit</u>, <u>North & South</u>, and <u>Life of Pi</u>&nbsp;afterward.&nbsp;

    Also: I didn&#8217;t want to brag about this on Facebook, but this is my blog and I can dang well do what I please. I won two books and a $100 gift certificate to Deseret Book! AHHHHHHHHHH! LIFE IS GREAT.

    <b>Family:&nbsp;</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Family is great. My relationship with my siblings is better than it&#8217;s ever been, however, I still do have a lot to improve upon. But now I realize how valuable each one of them is, and I want to help them realize it.&nbsp;

    <b>Dating:&nbsp;</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    Ha ha. Ha. Weeelll . . . I didn&#8217;t think it would ever come to this, but I&#8217;ve finally reached that stage that everyone says happens right before you meet Mr. Right: I could really care less. I love my life, I love being single, and I am more content than I&#8217;ve ever been. I have never been so happy with myself, which is exciting, because I know that I can be <i>more </i>happy with myself. I still have a lot of weaknesses to strengthen and improve upon, but knowing that almost makes it easier. I think I&#8217;ve found my golden ticket, and it&#8217;s great, because it only relies on me and my Heavenly Father, not anybody else. So if you ask me how my love life is going, I&#8217;ll probably tell you that it isn&#8217;t, really, but that I really don&#8217;t mind.&nbsp;

    <b>Spiritual:&nbsp;</b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    I&#8217;m trying to get in the habit of going to the temple once a week. So far it&#8217;s been sort of rough, but I&#8217;m going to do it. If there&#8217;s one thing I definitely need to improve upon, it&#8217;s my spiritual well-being. I&#8217;ve got a long way to go.&nbsp;
