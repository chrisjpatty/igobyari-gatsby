So, my birthday’s coming up in two days. It’ll feel like the perfect night to dress up like hipsters and make fun of our exes, uh uh, uh uh.

Yeah. So I’m going to be 22! I’ve been feeling 22 for the past four months. It’s kind of a boring age, excepting the fact that it has a wildly popular song named after it. Which, for all intents and purposes, is less of a song about birthdays and more of a song about being a poser. I’ve debated taking my birth date off of Facebook for fear that I’ll be assaulted by Taylor Swift music videos. No joke. (I’m sorry, friends. I know some of you are big T-Swift fans, but I just…I can’t.)

At any rate, I’ve done my best to compile a good, alternative list of songs for the 22-year-olds among us in an attempt to keep us all cultured and non-cliche’. Some of them are about birthdays, some of them are about heartache, some of them really have nothing to do with 22, but whatever.

Thanks for reading!
