_\*Anonymous letters to attractive, cool, and frustrating gentlemen _

Dear Zak,  
You and I shared a date once upon a time. 

Now that you’re back from school for the summer, I keep thinking about it. 

I’ll be the first to say that I hope you ask again. 

I really hope you’ll ask again. 

Love,  
Sara

P.S.: You still look really great in plaid. 

Dear Mr. Elton, 

Now that Harriet has the farm boy she always wanted, 

I worry that you’re forcing your hopes up again. 

Let me be clear: I don’t/can’t/and will never like you in that way. 

I don’t know what else to say.  
Sincerely,  
Emma 

Dear John Thornton, 

Yeah. You’re still kind of obnoxious, rude, and cocky. 

I think we’re done. 

Sincerely, 

Margaret Hale 

Dear #4, 

I still wonder what could have happened with us. 

I think about you often. 

Now that you’ve graduated, chances are that you’ll never see me again. 

I hate how awful that makes me feel. 

Love, 

Me 

Dear Chris Martin,  

You’re a really neat guy. 

We’ve made a great team, methinks. 

I’ll miss you when you leave. 

Sincerely, 

Rihanna 

Dear Watermelon, 

You should come talk to me more often. 

I think you’re kind of cute.

Sincerely, 

Cake

Dear Mr. Collins, 

Apparently you’ve found your Charlotte. 

This worries me a bit. 

Lizzie 

Dear #5, 

It’s obvious that you’re attracted to every woman under the sun. 

Ugh. I was such an idiot. 

Sincerely,  
Me 

Dear Rude Boy, 

If I would have done what I felt like doing, 

you would have had a red handprint across your face on Monday. 

If you are _ever_ as ungentlemanly as you were to me again, 

you’re going to get it. 

Sincerely, 

Wrathful Girl

Dear Henry,  
I think you’re a nice guy, and I did have fun on our date.  
I just don’t feel like it’s going to work.  
Margaret

Dear Arthur, 

We met very briefly before school ended. 

I hope we meet again soon. 

Love, 

Francine 

Dear Half of the LDSSA Counsel, 

I have an itsy bitsy crush on all of you boys. 

You’re incredible. 

Love, 

Publicity Prez
