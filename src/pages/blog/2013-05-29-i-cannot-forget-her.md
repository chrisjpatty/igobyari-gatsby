pasty linoleum,  
fish-eyed fifteen year-olds,  
cluttered restroom counters,  
cafeteria milk cartons  
crunched into Stonehenge  
monuments through  
the halls

days in tinsel town  
when the future  
was unpredictable  
but we weren’t

you and I weren’t

smashing lockers,  
tears in bathroom stalls,  
shirts ripped untucked,  
up-dos after laughed-at  
attempts to curl my  
hair on my own,  
long and angry letters,  
cold and bitter shoulders,  
shrinking away into  
spaceless corners, wherein  
I prayed you couldn’t  
find enough air  
to say the things  
you said to me

making jokes you said  
you never meant,  
making jabs you said  
would make me stronger

a day after you told me my hair  
was ugly long,  
I chopped all of it off  
and couldn’t look at myself  
in the mirror without wanting  
to cry

I loved you like a sister  
because you had great moments,  
moments that are harder  
for me to remember

if you knew how many times  
I’ve written about you,  
how many times you’ve influenced  
everything I’ve ever said  
and everything I’ve ever done  
since then . . .

I don’t know how you’d feel

grown up, we talk,  
mostly about what’s important,  
we can have a conversation  
without it ending in a fight now

but now and again  
I can see that tone in your sentences,  
feel my heart tremble,  
feel myself shrink away  
because everything comes back

I catch myself grabbing  
at my shoulder-length hair  
and catch tears I  
didn’t realize were coming

the girl you were still haunts me  
and I cannot forget her
