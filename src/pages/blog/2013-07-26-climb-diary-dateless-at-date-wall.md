_A climb from clear back in early July (or June) that I forgot to document. _

Climb theme:

The wall: NCMO? No clue. Guessing 5.8.

Commentary: Don’t ever do Date Wall before 3 or 4 pm. It’s KILLER in the sun. But it is a pretty good climb for beginners. Hence “date.” It’s where all the climbers bring their dates climbing for the first time. But there are way cooler walls. Just sayin’.
