_Yes. I am going here. _

Twenty four hours ago, I was minding my own business on Twitter when I noticed #TheDress pop on my trending bar. Curious, I clicked on it. Within minutes, the WHOLE INTERNET WAS EXPLODING.

Sometimes, when things like this go viral, my stomach gets all angsty feeling and I start breathing thin air and I pace my room and I rant, “Why can’t things that actually matter go viral?! This is SO ridiculous. I don’t understand why people care so much about something so meaningless. WHY? WHY? WHY?!”

But then, I started reading comments. And I laughed at one that was funny. And then I couldn’t stop laughing. Like, it was 11:00 pm and I went into the kitchen and got a bowl of frosted mini-wheats and glued myself to my computer, nearly choking on mini-wheats, I was laughing so hard.

I learned a valuable lesson from that dress. For one, people are ridiculous. But more importantly:  
**_we take ourselves and life way too seriously. _**  
President Hinckley once said, “Life is to be enjoyed, not just endured.” Maybe that means that we are allowed to have a big, collective laugh about a freaky dress once in awhile, to take one night of our lives and enjoy the pleasure of something that isn’t painful or hard, just goofy. Should people care more about the hard things going on in the world? Sure. Is human suffering more important than a dress? Definitely.

But do we have to constantly badger ourselves about all that is bad and not good and falling apart in the world and have a complete meltdown every time something trivial gets popular? Of course not.

Let’s all try harder to not be so irritated all of the time. It’s easy to be. I know. As a girl who _frequently_ writes when irritated, I know all too well how easy it is to feed that irritation.

But life is silly and the planet is weird and our brothers and sisters are quirky and fascinating.

Let’s all just take one big breath of air and lighten up.

Also: the dress is definitely blue and black, no matter what you people say. 😉
