    Today I went into Hastings for the second time in a week in an attempt to spend a gift card. The first time I went in this month, I felt like I was drowning in the Death Star trash compactor and had to leave within fifteen minutes. It&#8217;s been years since I went to Hastings. I never realized how many <i>things </i>are in there. Like movies, books, magazines, food, coffee, children&#8217;s books, trinkets, bobbleheads, keychains, games, video games, etc. I should not be surprised, as the general trend leans less towards bookstores and more towards nerdy crap stores, but it caught me waaaay off guard.&nbsp;

    Truth be told, I hate bookstores. The fact that I have to swim through so much junk to get to real, tangible literature just reaffirms my hatred.&nbsp;

    I always go into them with one thing in mind. I always walk out of them with at least two bags, feeling like I signed away my soul. I&#8217;ve got a real problem &#8212; I spend a disproportionate amount of my money on books. Part of me realized this when I looked at my bookshelf and found out that I had accidentally bought multiple copies of at least three books I own without realizing it. If that&#8217;s not enough, I officially have read a pittance of a 1/3rd of all of the books I own. ONE THIRD.

    Hello. My name is Arianna, and I am addicted to book-buying.&nbsp;

    Every time I walk into a store, I say to myself, &#8220;This time it will be different. This time everything will be okay.&#8221; Well, it&#8217;s never okay. Even today, when I *cue drumroll* only walked out with <b>ONE BOOK (IT&#8217;S A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE), </b>I still had a miserable trip. I found myself browsing through keychains and historical fiction books and self-help books.&nbsp;

    Cue typical self-talk:&nbsp;<i>You need a self-help book, Ari. Look! This one&#8217;s about being an entrepreneur. You&#8217;ll need that one day when the Apocalypse wipes out the free market. Oh! Look! A bound copy of Dante&#8217;s </i><u><i>Divine Comedy</i>.</u>&nbsp;<i>You legitimately NEED that. I don&#8217;t care if you hated Inferno. BUY IT. Oh! Oh! Abraham Lincoln&#8217;s biography! If you walk out of the store without that, you are a traitor to your kind. I will never speak to you again and your personal collection at home will burst into metaphysical flames. FLAMES, I TELL YOU.</i>

    If you ignore the self-talk, you get pounded with a &#8220;look at how many books there are in the world that you want to read but will never read because you&#8217;re cheap&#8221; headache. If you don&#8217;t ignore it, you spend more money than you wanted and get a &#8220;look what you&#8217;ve done, you idiot, there goes your paycheck&#8221; headache. IT&#8217;S A LOSE-LOSE SITUATION. To make things worse, bookstores are like what I imagine bars are like. Yeah, you can walk into one and possibly find a Han Solo or an old Jedi friend lounging at a table, but chances are more likely that you&#8217;re going to run into a bunch of slime-covered, incisor baring, death stick selling Greedos with a penchant for murdering people in cold blood without batting an eye and dancing on tables in chains.</p>

    Bookstores are slime-filled cesspools that always smell like coffee and mold. I hate them, but oh, I love them so much. Which is why I hate them even more.&nbsp;
