My brother graduated from high school today. Heâ€™s getting old! Iâ€™m getting old. I know I say that itâ€™s stupid to celebrate high school graduation because itâ€™s easy to graduate from high school, but Iâ€™m still proud of him.

Look at that confident stride.

A familiar sight.

Since when have all of these girls been following him around? ðŸ˜‰

Â It reminds me of the good old days. Like last year when my sister graduated:

Or when _I_ graduated. Itâ€™s amazing how much has changed since then.Â
