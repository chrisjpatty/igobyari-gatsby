Well, sorta. Team-effort published. 

I guess you could say that I’m a published illustrator. Never in five billion years did I think I’d illustrate a book before writing one — I didn’t even know Photoshop until this year. Ha. Life does funny things to you like that. 

But yeah! After a summer interning with the English Department’s _Voices: On Stage and In Print_ program, we churned out a pretty amazing book. I only take credit for the cover and a bit of editing. The inside is just as magnificent, if not more so.  

 What an amazing experience!

Front cover in all its glory.

This year’s compared with the 2011 edition.
