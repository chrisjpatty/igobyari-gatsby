  For the past month, I have started and then stopped writing at least a dozen blog posts. I&#8217;ve opened my laptop with every intention of expressing my thoughts, only to leave it disheartened time after time after time. I&#8217;ve been silent, unsure of what to say, how to say it, or if it&#8217;s even worth saying. I&#8217;ve hated the idea of adding one more heated opinion into an already contentious space. I&#8217;ve hated the idea of being confronted, of having to confront. I&#8217;ve hated the idea of expressing myself as if I know it all, knowing full well that I don&#8217;t, that some days, I&#8217;m astounded at how little I actually understand. I&#8217;ve allowed fear to eat up the one good thing I feel I have to give back to the world: a voice. I&#8217;ve been a coward, and my writing&#8217;s gone rusty while I try to figure out how to respond.

Orlando and Dallas and, generally, the state of the world, have just about torn me apart. It seems that just as we begin healing, someone has to cause harm again. Cuts are made on top of scars on top of scars on top of scars. Bodies that have just gone cold have had more bodies thrown on top of them. Life, that delicate, beautiful, and vivid thing we all share is at every corner smothered out and pinned behind the glass some madman labels &#8220;A Statement.&#8221; Humanity is poisoning itself to prove its worth. And, if you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ve watched on from behind your phones or your computers and felt the devastatingly heavy weight of the thought, &#8220;What good can ever be done to end this?&#8221; like it&#8217;s the lid of a coffin closing on top of you.

This week, I&#8217;ve learned what it is that we can do.

We can stop being the same thing we were yesterday, the same cowering person who hides instead of running in to help. We can stop ripping apart the weak, the hurt, and the different, stop hosting pointless, heated wars on social media that do nothing for understanding and instead, polarize further. We can take a long, hard look at ourselves and stop doing bad things or cruel things, justifying our own callousness or conceit. We can be the good in a world gone mad, in a world that keeps doing and saying the same old things that just don&#8217;t work.

The world thinks forgiveness is a sign of weakness, that it validates bad choices and enslaves us. **_So f_**_**orgive. **_

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The world thinks evolution botched up on humanity and we&#8217;re all destined to be animals. <em><strong>See us as something divine. </strong></em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The world thinks an eye for an eye is justified. <em><strong>Show mercy. </strong></em>
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The world thinks outrage is the only way to get anything done. <em><strong>Share love.</strong></em>
</p>

We are not a generation of Martin Luther Kings if our immediate reaction to bad things happening is to create chaos. We are not a generation of giants if we resort to violence and rage instead of love and empathy. We won&#8217;t do a single bit of good for anything or anybody if we continue to put ourselves in camps. turn &#8216;us&#8217; into &#8216;them,&#8217; and make space for hatred.

I can&#8217;t seem to say a single thing that isn&#8217;t cliche&#8217; when it comes to tragedy right now. Just be good. Just be optimistic, better, and more empathetic. See brothers and sisters instead of enemies. Speak up and speak out, but speak kindly.

Please share more good. Please. We all need it.
