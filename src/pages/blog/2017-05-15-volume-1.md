  One of my <a href="http://semi-rad.com/">favorite blogs is SEMI-RAD</a>, mostly because it&#8217;s freaking funny and filled with lots of tongue-in-cheek outdoors tips, which I love. The blogger, Brendan Leonard, has a series that he updates every Friday called &#8220;Friday Inspiration.&#8221; In it, he unloads all of the best stuff he&#8217;s found on the Internet that week. As we all know, the Internet can often be the armpit of humanity: dark and disgusting. It&#8217;s nice to take a break from all of that and see the silver lining. So, to follow in the footsteps of Brendan Leonard and add what I hope will be a little more joy to the world wide web, here is the first in my own series of best stuff found online. Enjoy!

This week, I found THE ONE.

  * This one dude filmed one second of every day he was hiking the PCT and [it&#8217;s pretty beautiful. ][1]
  * I discovered a poet named Rudy Francisco this week, and his poetry just gets under my skin. It&#8217;s so beautiful. Here&#8217;s one he had posted on his Facebook page that I just adore:<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-2858 aligncenter" src="https://www.igobyari.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rudy-francisco-300x300.jpg" alt="rudy francisco" width="300" height="300" />
  * [This Facebook album about dogs][2] is the best thing ever. It made me laugh really hard.
  * I follow about 20 different National Park Facebook accounts, and nothing makes my day like seeing pictures like this get posted:
