    For almost four years now, I&#8217;ve been living a lie. For four years, I&#8217;ve been driving around in a car with a plate tacked on the back proclaiming, &#8220;Utah! The Greatest Snow On Earth!&#8221; as if I&#8217;m an expert on the slopes of Utah. As if I, like dozens of the people I went to high school with, leave my mediocre winter weekdays to spend my Saturdays skiing or snowboarding and come back with a smug grin and a bad sunburn and proclaim, &#8220;Guess what, guys? I went to the Beav&nbsp;<i>again</i>.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I figured, with the Stake Ski night upcoming and as part of my moral obligation, that I would do my darndest to go and make it so that one day, when I cross the path of a random stranger from some other state, like Nebraska, and he asks me, &#8220;Is it&nbsp;<i>really&nbsp;</i>the &#8216;Greatest Snow On Earth&#8217;,&#8221; I can look off into the distance, close my eyes with a soft smile, and say, with a nostalgic note, &#8220;Yes sir. I do believe it is.&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So I signed up, dressed up, and made my way through the canyon. Beaver&#8217;s beautiful at night, I&#8217;ll give it that. All lit up like a baseball diamond in the summer. Except no baseball and no summer. Just snow. Ice, actually.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    You should have seen me. I clunked around in my sister&#8217;s boots with my brother&#8217;s borrowed snowboard, plastered in stickers that screamed &#8220;X-Treme!&#8221; and &#8220;XBALM&#8221; and &#8220;Skiing makes me board!&#8221; Haha. Ha. Another fiendish facade similar to my &#8220;Greatest Snow On Earth&#8221; plate.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here&#8217;s the low down. If I had had a snowboarding/skiing resume before last night, it would have said one thing: Experience snowboarding down a small hill into the river bottoms. So basically I suck.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I went down the tiny little hill next to the ticket office at Beaver and promptly fell on my palms, a move that would become my signature move the rest of the night.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a name='more'></a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Things went downhill from there. I went around a corner to go down to the lift and suddenly it was as if I was on the freeway. I accidentally cut straight across the long slope where tons of people were skiing/boarding. I don&#8217;t know how I didn&#8217;t kill someone. I was going so fast that I almost had fun. Then I realized that the lift was getting closer and closer, and I didn&#8217;t know how to brake. Like, at all. The sign&nbsp;<b>SLOW&nbsp;</b>pushed me into panic mode.&nbsp;<b>DEATH</b>, it read.&nbsp;<b>THE END!&nbsp;</b>it screamed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I did the only thing I knew how to do to save innocent bystanders. I squirmed like a fish and wiggled hard enough that my board flew off of the snow and I flipped head over heels about five times, sacrificing my body for the good of others. I feel that I saved lives last night. Actually, I feel like a punk for not learning how to brake before doing the serious stuff. Aye yigh yigh.
  </p>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
  </div>
  
  <p>
    From that point on, I stuck to the tiny little slope on the other side. And I fell again and again and again and again. I was taught how to brake, which didn&#8217;t ever help me, really. Then the dreaded invitation came.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Kyle, a boy in my ward, said, &#8220;Ari! Come on a slope with me!&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I was like a protesting child. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to! No! You can&#8217;t make me! No!&#8221;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ten minutes later, I was sitting on a lift bench and shaking so hard that I could have slipped off and died. I&#8217;ll admit it. In the darkness, I was bawling. I was TERRIFIED.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am truly terrified of only a few things in this world, namely karaoke, driving in the snow, and giant sea creatures that swim in the shadow of darkness so that they are just a dark blob in deep water swimming as fast as they can toward you to eat you. Snowboarding fear was a new thing.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I didn&#8217;t want to go down that stupid slope. I was perfectly happy with saying that I had wasted $10 to go down a slight incline, but nooooo. I had to cave. With the grace of a crippled stork, I fell flat on my face while getting off the lift. I have no balance whatsoever.&nbsp;Then a mob of skiers shot past me and left me feeling like an idiot. I mean, some of these guys had topographic maps for ski suits and will probably end up with five year-old ski prodigies for children. They were legit.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At first, I sat there on the hill shaking, staring at the dark, shadowy border ledge that was mere feet away from me. I am convinced that it dropped to nowhere, a deep, dark, black pit of doom and despair. And I was going to go right off of it and die.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Finally I got up and went down the hill. Sorta. I ended up faceplanting. Badly. So badly that if snow hadn&#8217;t been in every opening of my face, I would have screamed. I sat there and I cried.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I was stuck on the top of a slope with the wind stinging my red face, the lights of the lodge like some far off beacon I would never make it to. I couldn&#8217;t go back. I had to go down. It was horrifying. Yes, I&#8217;m a coward, but at that moment, I realized, &#8220;You know what Ari? You don&#8217;t have to like everything you try, nor do you have to be good at everything you try. So stop pretending.&#8221; Just like that, I admitted what I was feeling the whole night: I hate snowboarding. With a passion.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Beaver mountain used to be this mystical place where all of the cool kids got to go after being pulled out of school. It used to be this goal that I aimed for as a child.&nbsp;<i>If I can just get to Beaver, I can like winter</i>.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Alas, winter and I are still on bad terms, maybe even worse terms.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I ended up improvising. I cut across the slope on foot, then I sat down and slid down on my snow pants, which made me laugh without crying for the first time that night. Of course, I got my pants tangled and it felt weird, but it was super fun.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    After meeting up with Kyle at the next hill, I sat there, asking myself, &#8220;Do I really want to finish this out on my board or not?&#8221; I improvised again. Snowboards make excellent sleds!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I walked away last night feeling bruised, battered, but not broken! I finally did it. I got to Beaver. I will never be a Shaun White because I stink. Frankly, I don&#8217;t ever want to be a Shaun White. And I will never ride something down a snowy hill with the grace of some of my fellow stake members. I&#8217;d rather stick to hiking and rock climbing. Mountains are ten times less intimidating without snow on them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But I can cross off number 75 on my Bucket List. Success.

    Maybe I&#8217;ll try skiing next time. It always sounded so glamorous in all of those Nancy Drew novels. &#8220;Scandal at the Slopes&#8221; or &#8220;Murder on the Mountain.&#8221; Something with good alliteration.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I learned that just because you have two feet on the same piece of material doesn&#8217;t mean you are more safe.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <b>Other lessons learned:&nbsp;</b><br />-Learning how to stop is more important than learning how to go<br />-Falling is inevitable, so deal with it<br />-If you&#8217;re on a slope, you either buck up and get down it on your board or you improvise<br />-A true measure of success can be felt through trying<br />-You don&#8217;t have to like everything. You&#8217;re allowed to hate a few things.<br />-Beaver is no longer what defines &#8220;having a good time&#8221; in winter for me, which is quite liberating.<br />-My siblings who can snowboard are like deities. How?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Maybe one day I&#8217;ll run into that Nebraska man and he&#8217;ll ask me, &#8220;Is it really the &#8216;Greatest Snow On Earth&#8217;?&#8221; And I&#8217;ll say, with my eyes toward the skies, a dramatic pause in my voice, &#8220;I went snowboarding. Once.&#8221; Then I&#8217;ll walk away feeling fulfilled.
