So my friend took her playlist, put it on shuffle, and used the first lines of each song to form a poem. I’m stealing her idea. Here’s the monstrosity I’ve created with my own favorites list:

It’s been so long, I’ve been out of my body with you 

You know I said it’s true

I’m waking up to ash and dust 

Try to hear my voice 

Slow hard, dog, wait, down love, black canvas 

I’m coming up only to hold you under 

I’m waking up to ash and dust 

East London’s not a bomb site 

Welcome to your life 

Oh I just wanna take you anywhere that you like 

I don’t like walking around this old and empty house 

I was supposed to do great things 

I had a dream so big and loud 

You’re killing me, kid 

Whatever you do, I do it, too 

Here we are with our backs against the wall 

When life leaves you high and dry 

You’ll never feel happy 

Roll away your stone, I’ll roll away mine 

It doesn’t hurt me 

Easing out, with my heart 

Well I woke up to the sound of silence 

Some saw the sun, some saw the smoke 

Hope when you take that jump, you don’t feel the fall 

I am my mother’s only one 

Pretty girls come from the ugliest places 

I’m waking up to ash and dust 

I know the time has numbered my days 

I’ve seen the world, done it all, had my cake now 

I’ll keep you safe. 

_I apparently have at least three variations of_ Radioactive _on my playlist. Who knew? _
