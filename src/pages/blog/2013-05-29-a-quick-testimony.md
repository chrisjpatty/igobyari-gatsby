Visiting teaching has done more good for me than I think it has done for anyone we’ve taught. You think it’s an obligation that forces you to serve others, but it’s really a blessing that helps you to understand who you and the people around you are. For a half hour or so, you get to bring someone the spirit. That is incredible!

Tonight I felt a bit miserable, but I somehow managed to pick the exact message _I_ needed to hear tonight. After visiting with one of our sisters, I felt so, so good. And happy.

Visiting teaching does this consistently. That’s why we need to do it.
