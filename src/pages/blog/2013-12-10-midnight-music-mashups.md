Struggling with finals? Sometimes the best remedy for my school problems is music. And speaking of which, here are some super sweet music mashups and parodies I’ve been OBSESSED with this month. (Apologies in Advance: Ylvis is on here, like, 500 times.) Listen and enjoy! And if you don’t watch anything else, PLEEEEAAASE, for all that is good in the world, listen to Indian Thriller. It’s my particular favorite. 

This is probably annoying, but it’s so fantastic. I really want to see someone try to incorporate choreography from both videos into a dance. That would be EPIC.

Duck Dynasty and Lorde. Funny and great. 

This one is weird. And it caught me off guard, but I like it a little. 

This is my FAVORITE VIDEO OF ALL TIME. Seriously. Pull this thing out on a bad day, and all your cares will fly away. 

Contemporary Britpop. I really like this one, because it blends music I listen to with music my parents grew up with and taught me to love. 

Fox Dubstep, for all you beat droppers out there. (I have no idea what I just said.) 

My brother showed this one to me, and it is classy. 

I hate how much I like this one. Like, I really hate it, but I love it. 

Imagine Dragons and We the Kings. Golden. Just golden. 

For all you Bastille fans out there. This one’s neat. 

Found this tonight. Immediately fell in love. 

Fox Rick Roll. THIS WINS THE INTERNET.

THIS FOR REASONS. It’s oddly romantic, and I really adore both songs. 

Another contemporary Britpop mix. And it’s so great. 

I’m sorry. I’m sorry. This is the last Fox one. It’s so wonderful, though. 

This because it works CRAZY well. 

And finally, the greatest fan vid. I’ve ever seen in my life. I have the biggest crush on this video. 

Hope you enjoyed these! 

Okay. I lied.
