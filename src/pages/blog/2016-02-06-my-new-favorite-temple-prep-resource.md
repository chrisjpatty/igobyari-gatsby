If I haven’t blogged in awhile, it’s probably because I’ve been reading my brains out to achieve the one resolution I never seem to keep — read one book a week, or at least 100 a year. The past few months have been crazy due to this ridiculous resolution, which I’ve kind of given up on. Usually, I stick to one book and one book only until said one book is finished. Last month, however, I somehow managed to find myself trapped between two self-help books, a classic as thick as my face, a book by Tad Callister, and the lovely book pictured below. It was one of only two that I finished this last month, and I want to take a short post to share it with you.

When I started this book, I was under the erroneous assumption that it was only for people who have just gone through the temple. I thought it was a temple prep book. It seems like it, as it tends to feel pretty basic in parts. Truth is that it _is_ a temple prep book, but it’s one for both the new temple goer and the seasoned temple goer alike.

I guess you could say this book was a bit of a wake up call for me, as it’s been easy to lull into that state where you’re complacent about your covenants and about your temple attendance. I think we all, at some point, slip into the experience of going through the temple as fast as we can and not treating it like something new and special every time. I vividly remember how much every word meant to me when I first went through. They were a BIG DEAL, these promises and blessings I was making and hearing, and I wanted to make completely sure that I was ready to make them. Nowadays, if I’m not careful, I’ll sit through a session without taking the time to seriously consider it. This book was a very good reminder for me that I need to _constantly_ be taking my temple trips seriously. How do I learn and progress, otherwise?

This book was filled with really fantastic insights that made me sit back and vocally go, “Huh.” a few times. My favorite books are books that teach me something new, and this book did that while also being super edifying. It has great examples of symbolism, historic temple ceremonies, and even greater perspective as to why we say and do what we say and do in the temple. I found myself wanting to take this with me to the temple to study it, in fact. Not sure I could get away with sneaking it in my temple dress…but I’ll certainly be putting it near and in my temple bag!

If your temple attendance has felt uninspiring lately, check this book out! I’ll even let you borrow it.
