    1. I&#8217;ve got a bit of road rage in me, because where I live, people drive like they&#8217;re going into labor before the hospital EVERY DAY.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    2. When I was little, I wanted to be an astronaut. I was going to see the stars. Instead, I write about them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    3. This is super embarrassing to admit, but my guilty pleasure song of the moment is the edited version of Thrift Shop, which I accompany with aviators, heavy head bobs, and record-scratching hand movements. Yeeaaah.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    4. I&#8217;ve never really liked cheesecake.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    5. I love dancing. Right before writing this post, in fact, I was trying to Bollywood dance &#8212; which is one of the most beautiful kinds of dances in the world, in my humble opinion.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    6. It literally makes me feel physically ill to read or write &#8216;lol&#8217;. Therefore, I never EVER use it. Except now. *twitching*
  </p>
  
  <p>
    7. I hate being a registered Republican. There. I said it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    8. I am OBSESSED with period romances. I&#8217;ve watched Pride & Prejudice at least 32 times in the past three years, I melt into a puddle whenever I watch North & South, I sobbed during the new Jane Eyre movie, and I have a playlist on YouTube devoted to my favorite clips.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    9. For the longest time, I said I hated hipsters. In reality, I&#8217;m incredibly attracted to them.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    10. The quickest way to charm me is to show me a good parody. I ADORE parodies.
