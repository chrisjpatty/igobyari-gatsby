    I hate introducing new blogs. It&#8217;s kind of like introducing your parents to the guy you&#8217;re currently dating for the first time:&nbsp;
  </div>

  </div>
  
  <div>
    &#8220;So, uh, guys. This is my blog. You know, the one I&#8217;ve been telling you all about with, like, the same interests I have and we met on the Internet and I promise he&#8217;s not as sloppy as he looks and, uh, yeah. I hope you like him.&#8221;&nbsp;
  </div>

    I guess it&#8217;s <i>waaaaaaay </i>less awkward, unless, like me, you go through blogs like socks. Heh heh. And, by the way, just in case you were curious, I deleted my last blog to give up blogging before reading a few blogs and going, &#8220;I MUST BLOG.&#8221;&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    So, anyway, hi guys! Welcome to my new blog! (And I <i>promise </i>this one&#8217;s sticking around.) Follow, subscribe, read quietly and awkwardly from a distance without any indication that you pay one teaspoon of attention to my life . . . whatevs.&nbsp;

  <div>
    Just say hello every now and again. :] &nbsp;</p>
