being left alone in deep water  
karaoke  
having a shark creep up underneath me  
failing spectacularly in front of a crowd  
scathing criticism  
being vulnerable in my writing  
talking about my insecurities  
having the ones I love leave me  
water skiing  
sea snakes  
being attacked by a spider  
lead climbing and having to fall a few feet if my grip slips  
drinking out of a Capri Sun and finding mold at the bottom
