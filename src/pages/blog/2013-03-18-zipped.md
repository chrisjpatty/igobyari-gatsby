<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    My soul is its own blog with a thousand things written that I could and would never publish here, even if &#8216;here&#8217; was something private that only I could see and understand. I wish I could tell you everything.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    I wish I could mention names and tell their stories. I wish I hadn&#8217;t promised myself that I wouldn&#8217;t. I wish I wasn&#8217;t the queen of false assumptions, because if I wasn&#8217;t, I maybe wouldn&#8217;t think that everyone else was and that everyone else would read too far into something or much less than I&#8217;d hoped.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    I wish that I hadn&#8217;t written so much about them right before they left. Now I don&#8217;t write at all. &nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
  </div>
  
  <div style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
    My life is zipped, an &#8220;I solemnly swear to not write about him until I know he&#8217;ll stay&#8221; signed in broken handwriting across my fingertips. I may have to wait eons to write another name here.&nbsp;
