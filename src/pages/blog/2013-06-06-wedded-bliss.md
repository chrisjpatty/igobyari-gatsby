Today my good friend Kim got married to her sweetheart Jason. It was a really beautiful day, and it was the first wedding where I have been in the bridal party, so I had an entirely new perspective. Golly, it was great.

They were married in the Logan, Utah temple.

Me, Jamille, and Ann — bridesmaids and best friends.

Kim and Jason feeding each other cake. I was hoping they would smash it so badly that the carnage would be EVERYWHERE. Oh, well.
