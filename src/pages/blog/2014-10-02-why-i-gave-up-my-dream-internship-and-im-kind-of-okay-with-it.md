    Well, hi. This is awkward.

    Remember that one time when I got an internship with LDS Living Magazine and I was completely stoked about it? Like, beyond stoked?&nbsp;

    Things have changed. Namely: this weekend I will be coming home and not returning to Salt Lake City to work. Like, possibly ever.&nbsp;

    <b>You:</b> Gasp! Why, Ari?
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>Ari:</b> Good question. I have no idea.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>You:</b> But&#8230;but&#8230;I thought you loved it!<br /><b>Ari:</b> Well, I did. I do. It&#8217;s a fun environment to work in. My coworkers have been awesome. The blog setting is my favorite.
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>You: </b>Soooo&#8230;why?&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>Ari: </b>Because I felt like it&#8230;?&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>You:</b> But it was just four months!&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>Ari:</b> Why, yes, It was. How very astute of you.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>You: </b>So why?!
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>Ari: </b>Well, let me explain&#8230;

    About two weeks ago, I had what I imagine a midlife crisis/mental breakdown is. I could not sleep, I could not eat, I could not focus at work. My body shook, my mind raced, and I stayed home for four days to cope with what was essentially severe trauma and nausea. I was miserable. Frustrated. Lonely. Upset. Sick. The gamut.&nbsp;

    <b>You: </b>So, wait. Were you homesick?&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>Ari: </b>Hahahahaha. No.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>You: </b>But you do get homesick, you know.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>Ari: </b>Yes. Thank you for telling me what I already know.&nbsp;

    <b>You: </b>So&#8230;you&#8217;re just giving up?

    Sometimes I&#8217;ve sent unvoiced prayers to my Heavenly Father, asking him to please give me a poetic life, one that ends where it begins, that has meaning, that is emotive. That may sound silly, but so far, he&#8217;s doing a fairly good job.

    Four years after being led down a dead end that was my schooling, he&#8217;s led me down one that is my career path. Four years after tossing and turning at my aunt&#8217;s house in Sandy about what I should do, I&#8217;ve been tossing and turning at that same aunt&#8217;s house in Sandy about what I should do. Four years after coming to a decision and feeling happiness, clarity, and peace, I have done the same.

    Interestingly, after making the decision to move back to Cache Valley (like, my most recent decision to move back), I went to sleep and it was perfect. The next morning, I woke up concerned.&nbsp;
  </div>
  
  <div>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <i>Am I doing the right thing here? Did I rush into this decision?&nbsp;</i>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <i><br /></i>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    The answer came when I randomly opened my scriptures, a cross reference led me to D&C 6 (THE SAME CHAPTER THAT GOT ME THROUGH USU), and I read the following:</p> 
    
    <div style="background-color: white; color: #141823; line-height: 19.3199996948242px; margin-bottom: 6px; text-align: center;">
      <span style="font-family: inherit;">&#8220;Verily, verily, I say unto you, if you desire a further witness, cast your mind upon the night that you cried unto me in your heart, that you might know concerning the truth of these things.</span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-color: white; color: #141823; line-height: 19.3199996948242px; margin-bottom: 6px; margin-top: 6px; text-align: center;">
      <span style="font-family: inherit;">&#8220;Did I not speak peace to your mind concerning the matter? What greater witness can you have than from God?&#8221;</span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="background-color: white; display: inline; line-height: 19.3199996948242px; margin-top: 6px; text-align: left;">
    </div>
    
    <div style="color: #141823; text-align: center;">
      <span style="font-family: inherit;">D&C 6:22-23</span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="color: #141823; text-align: left;">
      <span style="font-family: inherit;"><br /></span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="color: #141823; text-align: left;">
      <span style="font-family: inherit;">That about settles it.&nbsp;</span>
    </div>
    
    <div style="color: #141823; text-align: left;">

    </div>
    
    <div style="text-align: left;">
      <span style="color: #141823; font-family: inherit;">Years after making the decision to stay at USU, I wrote the following:&nbsp;</span>
    </div>
    
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <span style="font-family: Georgia, Utopia, 'Palatino Linotype', Palatino, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18.4799995422363px;">In my short life, I have come to learn that answers don&#8217;t rest in a lineal line where we stand at point A and see them at point B. Answers, in my experience, always lie around corners, only reachable when we choose to move towards them with faith that they are there.</span>

        <span style="font-family: Georgia, Utopia, 'Palatino Linotype', Palatino, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18.4799995422363px;">Sometimes our dreams and the things we want don&#8217;t happen for us. We get dropped on an unfamiliar and unwanted road, let&#8217;s say. We tend to blame that on the Lord, and we misunderstand who He is by claiming that He wants to hurt us.&nbsp;</span><i style="font-family: Georgia, Utopia, 'Palatino Linotype', Palatino, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18.4799995422363px;">Why didn&#8217;t I get that job, pass that test, get asked on a second date, or get into the school I wanted?&nbsp;</i><span style="font-family: Georgia, Utopia, 'Palatino Linotype', Palatino, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18.4799995422363px;">We ask Heavenly Father.&nbsp;</span><i style="font-family: Georgia, Utopia, 'Palatino Linotype', Palatino, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18.4799995422363px;">I was doing so well, and you had to cut me down and move me here. How could you do that to me?</i>

        <span style="font-family: Georgia, Utopia, 'Palatino Linotype', Palatino, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 18.4799995422363px;">Well, He does it because He loves us. That&#8217;s always what motivates the Lord. And He, unlike us, can see around every bend. That&#8217;s why we must trust Him.&nbsp;</span>

        And because I wrote that, I am completely happy. Nervous? Yes. Unsure? Yes.&nbsp;
      </div>
      
      <div>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        But happy. The happiest I have felt in two weeks. And for now, that&#8217;s enough. Sweet is the peace the spirit brings.
