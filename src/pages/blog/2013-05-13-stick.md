So after months of being extremely jealous of Taylor Swift’s ability to KILL lipstick, I went out and bought my own tube. I have _never_ worn lipstick before in my life, guys. At least not seriously. It’s kinda embarrassing. Other than the fact that the tube was a blatant liar about what shade it was, I kinda liked it. What say ye?
