    I don&#8217;t want to be human. At least, not in the way we&#8217;ve made being human.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We&#8217;ve made being human a combination of tasks to do, money to earn, bills to pay, pain to feel, and noise to drown in. Being human is living 90% of an existence in four walls. Being human is sitting at a desk for eight hours a day. Being human is driving from here to there habitually, eating things we shouldn&#8217;t, coexisting with what we hate. Being human is conditioning ourselves to disconnect and disengage and repress.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We die realizing we&#8217;ve killed ourselves with ourselves. I don&#8217;t want to leave Earth realizing that I&#8217;ve done that.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Sometimes, when I let myself, I slip into places I&#8217;ve never been and I know what to do to not die by these things we say make us human: run. My desk fades away, my concerns quiet, and all I can see and feel inside me are jagged peaks drenched with snow. Music is playing and I am skiing, sometimes snowboarding, leaving tracks in clouds of powder, or sometimes just standing there among the trees, gasping at the immensity of it all, this space I never knew was tucked beneath my skin.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I open my bones, and there are mountains inside them. Desert, snow-capped peaks, woods, rocks, mountains. Endangered things. Delicate things. Things I want to touch and breathe in every day, and things I ache about, because I know they&#8217;re out there somewhere.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I don&#8217;t want to be human. I want to be wilderness. I want there to be no seam, no separation, no &#8220;how&#8217;s life?&#8221; &#8220;it&#8217;s going&#8221; in between me and untouched places.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Stitched together like that, I&#8217;d imagine I could live without fear or worry. Maybe one day I&#8217;ll try.
