<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  While cleaning my room today, I stumbled across binders filled with high school memories. I wasn&#8217;t going to look at them, but I somehow ended up with my legs crossed on the floor, sifting through pages and pages of things I&#8217;d forgotten about.</p> 
  
  <p>
    In one of them, I found literally dozens of certificates and awards.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <i>Arianna &#8212; Most Likely to Succeed</i><br /><i>Arianna &#8212; Congratulations on your outstanding copy writing!&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Arianna &#8212; Sterling Scholar Finalist&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Arianna &#8212; National Honor Society &#8212; 4 Years in a Row&nbsp;</i><br /><i>Arianna &#8212; Presidential Award for Outstanding Academic Achievement&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i>I ended up fighting tears and shoving those binders into a corner. The old me would be so disappointed.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It seems stupid, but I put so much effort into getting those papers and so much weight on them when I received them. When I looked at those tonight, I saw part of my soul, and I realized that the younger me would have been devastated to see her 3.9 drop to a 3.5, her hard-earned achievements tossed aside like they were worth nothing. Back then, that&#8217;s the only thing I had to hang on to. That and my stories. They were my credentials, my only source of confidence that was hard to come by.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And now I opened up one of my eleventh grade journals.<br /><i><br /></i><i>&#8220;Things will just get worse when I eventually fall in love with someone who likes my friends better.&#8221;</i><br /><i>&#8220;I always lose my best friends.&#8221;&nbsp;</i><br /><i>&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t I say anything </i>(or another variation of that)<i>? I&#8217;m so stupid.&#8221;&nbsp;</i><br /><i>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t a good editor. I&#8217;ll never be. I&#8217;ll never be brilliant. Never be original. I&#8217;m just stupid, selfish me.&#8221;</i><br /><i>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever find anyone who wants to talk to me and enjoy my company. Everyone hates me too much. And I know that Christ is always there but I just wish he could be here in person because he would understand me and cheer me up and want to be with me. No one else does.&#8221;&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i>I wrote those things. Me. And I can&#8217;t&#8230;if you could read what I&#8217;m reading right now&#8230;

    How did that little girl get through it all?&nbsp;
