So it’s almost the new year! Gaaaah. It’s crazy. I found this huge list of things to reflect on, and I thought it’d be fun. Here are 100 reflections of mine from this past year: 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Top 10 Year End Review Questions
--------------------------------

**What did you do this year that you have never done before?**

I skydived, had my voice recorded for a radio ad, and designed the cover of a book.  
  

**What was the smartest decision you made this year?**

Hmmm…I guess the smartest decision I’ve made this year is to actually ask Heavenly Father to help me put my burdens on the Savior’s shoulders. Many times I’ve asked Him to help me to be bolder than I am and to get over all of these traits I’ve called problems for so long, but it wasn’t until I asked for the application of the Atonement that I felt any change. The one time I asked, it completely changed the way I think about myself. I still struggle, yes, but I am not the same person that I was when the semester started because of that one prayer. 

  

**What one word best sums up and describes your last year experience?**

Well, since it hasn’t happened yet, I’m making a prediction: quaint. 

  

**What are you most happy about completing?**

The _Voices in Print_ book. I’ve been interning with the editors this year, and it was humbling to see a finished product on the bookstore shelf. 

  
**What was the biggest risk you took?**

I don’t know. Jumping out of an airplane at 12,000 feet…? No. The biggest risk I took this year was to open myself up to and love the people I work with on the Institute council. It is _extremely hard_ for me to be myself around people that I look up to and want to befriend. Extremely. It seems like a lame risk, but to a girl who went her whole life not opening up to anyone for fear of getting hurt, it’s a big one. One that’s blessed my life more than anything. 

  
**What are you most grateful for this past year?**

I am most grateful for people who serve selflessly. Those people have changed the lives of my family members and inspired me to be better than I am. 

  
**What was your biggest achievement of the year?**

Um, probably getting to the point where the things I’ve called weaknesses for most of my life are really quite endearing. In general, getting to the point where I’m not always berating myself for failing. Also: I kind of figured out makeup, which is really shallow and unimportant, but yeah. 

  

**What do you wish you had done more of?**

Spending time with people and in the mountains. 

  
**What do you wish you had done less of?**

Spending time on the Internet, because really, it’s a terrible thing sometimes. Also: complaining about problems instead of finding things to be optimistic about. 

  
**Knowing what you know now, if you could write a letter to yourself that would travel back in time so that you would receive it at the start of the year, what advice would you give your younger self?**

I’d tell myself to let things go and to not let my fears get in the way. 

10 Questions to Ask About Your Relationships
--------------------------------------------

**Who were the three people that had the greatest impact on your life last year?**

I have more than three. So many, but if I have to narrow it down, probably my bishop, my Institute adviser Brother Bateman, and a boy named Joe who I worked with for a few months in the bakery. Groups of people? My little publicity committee and the Institute council by far. 

  
**Did anyone close to you give birth?**

Pretty much everyone. That’s a slight exaggeration. I think every one of my married cousins had a baby this year, my aunt had a baby this year (unless it was last year), and a few friends from high school. 

  
**Did anyone close to you die?**

Not close to me, no, but close enough to my friends that I felt the effect.

  
**What important relationship improved the most?**

Probably the relationship with my sister. And a good friend from high school. 

  
**What important relationship suffered the most?**

There were a couple, namely a close friend whose life is quite different than mine now (which isn’t anyone’s fault, really) and a guy I knew for a few years and liked who ended up being a tool. 

  
**Whose behavior merited celebration?**

In general, lots of people I know. This is probably a cop out, but my boss/stake presidency member. He’s the most loving, cheerful, and selfless man you could ever work for. 

  
**Whose behavior made you appalled?**

Golly, I hate this question. Really, I’m just appalled by American adults who teach their kids to feel entitled and who, paradoxically, take offense to everything and nothing. And Congress. Always Congress.  

  
**How had you positively influenced a child this year?**

I taught one of my little cousins the proper way to play ping-pong. Does that count? 

  
**What well known person dead or alive influenced you the most this year?**

Malala Yousafzai. She is ten times a better person than I am or will ever be. 

  
**Who made you laugh the most this year?**

All those dorks who make Vines. And most of the Institute council boys. 

10 Questions to Ask About Your Health
-------------------------------------

**Did you suffer illness or injury?**

Not really, although I did get a horrendous trampoline burn at the Jump Zone. 

  
**What decision did you do to become healthier?**

I decided to buy a slackline and to go rock climbing more frequently. After working in the bakery, I’ve decided to cut down on my donut consumption BIG TIME.

  
**What was your favorite exercise this year?**

Climbing, climbing, climbing. 

  
**What was your favorite meal?**

Lasagna. Garfield is a wise sage when it comes to dining options. And sushi. Lots and lots of sushi. 

  
**What restaurant did you eat at most often?**

El Toro – a family favorite. And also the deli at Lee’s. I literally buy sushi at least once every two weeks there. 

  
**What medications are you currently taking?**

Aspirin . . . ? Not really any. 

  
**Did you have any surgeries this year?**

I had a root canal. 

  
**How did you manage your stress this year?**

Um…I still don’t know how to manage my stress. The best thing I can come up with is sleeping on it and then getting up bright and early to go to work. 

  
**What was your biggest health achievement this year?**

Climbing enough walls and lifting enough pans at the bakery to realize I have nice, strong muscles coming in. 

  
**What do you wish you would of done differently in regards to your health this year?**

Exercise WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY more. And not call it exercise so I can enjoy it. 

10 Questions to Ask About Your Pop Culture
------------------------------------------

**What were your favorite TV Programs?**

I got into Once Upon a Time for a few weeks, I got into Downtown Abbey for, like, three days, I’m a big fan of Dr. Phil. Really, the only show I’m caught up in is My Little Pony. 

  

**What were your favorite books?**

Mere Christianity by C.S. Lewis — basically the closest thing to scripture that you can get outside of scripture.

Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can’t Stop Talking by Susan Cain — this book literally changed my life and the way I think about myself. 

Counseling with Our Counsels by M. Russell Ballard — I think anyone with a calling in the LDS church should read this book, even anyone outside of it, because it’s excellent material on leadership. 

The Hobbitby J.R.R. Tolkien — because it’s truly magical. 

The Fault in Our Stars by John Green — because it makes you realize the importance of moments and it made me cry like a baby. 

Richard II by Shakespeare — because it’s an amazing play on politics and representation. 

Massacre at Mountain Meadows by Ronald W. Walker — because it’s a fascinating and fair representation of a horrifying event in Mormon history. 

Bad Guys of the Book of Mormon by Dennis Gaunt — because it was funny and brilliant. 

The Mysterious Benedict Society by Trenton Lee Stewart — because it’s basically the most magical, suspenseful children’s book I’ve read in a long time. 

  
**What was your biggest musical or art discovery?**

Imagine Dragons and We are the Strike, as far as music goes. 

As far as art goes, I’m a big fan of those hipster filtered star pictures. Not gonna lie. 

  
**What was your favorite movie this year?**

Frozen. Cutest and most incredibly inspirational movie I’ve seen in a long time. 

Austenland was pretty dang funny, too.

My Institute shirt and a pair of lacey shoes I bought awhile ago. I’ve also got a native-print maxi skirt I adore.  

  
**What was your hair style this year?**

Free and messy and long. 

  
**Describe your style of this past year in one word?**

Improving. Eventually: granola, native-girl, hippie-esque.

Definitely at school.There was a moment when I really loved what I was learning about, and it bled into all of my other classes. But generally, Institute inspires me every day up on campus.

Listening and asking questions. I was kind of thrown into both.

**What strengths did you tap into?**

My artistic abilities, my ability to voice my opinions well in writing, my listening skills as well as my sensitivity to others’ feelings. 

10 Questions to Ask About Your Spiritual and Existentialism
-----------------------------------------------------------

**Because of this past year, what do you believe is your purpose?**

I believe my purpose is to stick up for God’s children and defend those I can. I think, too, that my purpose is to bring happiness and hope and understanding through my talents. 

  
**What is one word that describes your relationship with God this year?**

Codependent. I realize that I depend on Him for everything, and He depends on me to do what is right. 

**Where did you find the most peace and calm this year?**

At Institute and at the temple.

  

**Where did you feel most connected to God this year?**

Probably in the mountains and in the middle of every service project I’ve been involved with. 

  
**What is one miracle you witnessed this year?**

I saw the Atonement literally change someone I love very much. It changed the way they act and their relationship with people, and that, to me, was an incredible miracle. 

  
**What was the most loving service you performed last year?**

I don’t really know. I can tell you that the most loving service anyone gave me was to tell me how much they felt Heavenly Father loved me. The timing for that could not have been better. 

  
**What is your biggest piece of unfinished business?**

I’ve got to work on self-discipline and get myself in the temple on a habitual, weekly basis.  

  
**What is the greatest lesson you have learned this year?**

I have learned that my weaknesses don’t define me. I find that definition wherever and whenever I can love and serve another human being. Side note in relation to dating: I learned that differences are what make people attractive and beautiful, not always similarities. 

  
**What was the best part of this year? What was the lesson learned?**

The best part of this year was working on the Institute council. I’ve learned why delegation is so important, I’ve learned why service is so critical, and I’ve learned how people love and how I love people. 

  
**What was the worst part of this year? What was the lesson learned?**

The worst part of this year was realizing, through myself and through the ignorance of others, that I get in the way of a lot of my opportunities. I let the fear of vulnerability direct me, and it usually ends with me breaking my own heart or someone else doing it. Lesson learned: vulnerability is the reason, but also the solution, for heartache. 

10 Questions to Ask About Your Time
-----------------------------------

**What date from this year will remain etched upon your memory and why?**

Oh, man. Is it bad that I can only think of bad ones? I puked on one and I got stuck in really awkward conversations on some others. Truth be told, I don’t date enough to have a good response to this question. We did a service project on one, and that was really, really nice.

AWKWARD EDIT: We’re talking about day date, aren’t we? Sigh. Well…probably January 27th. It was the worst day of my life, but also a day where one of my relationships improved and changed significantly. 

  
**What was your single biggest time waster in your life this past year?**

THE INTERNET. BY FAR.

  
**What slowed you down this past year?**

My fear of being vulnerable. 

  
**What was the best way you used your time this past year?**

Magnifying my calling. It has blessed me immensely. 

  
**What were you doing on most Saturday mornings this past year?**

Sleeping in before going to work. Wow, I’m lame. 

  
**During this past year, what were you doing at 3pm during the weekdays?**

Sitting in the middle of a class, going to work, or longboarding and climbing during the summer. 

  
**How did you spend your Sunday evenings this past year?**

Spending quiet time at home and with family when I maybe should have gone to ward prayer. 

  
**What person(s) occupied most of your time?**

You guessed it. The Institute council. Always. 

  
**What was your bedtime and wake up time?**

I usually went to bed by 11:00 pm and woke up by 7:00 am.

  
**If you had more time to invest in this past year what would you do with it?**

Take more risks, go on more adventures, and serve more people.
