<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  Today in combined Relief Society/Elders&#8217;, we had a chat about new year&#8217;s resolutions, and I got to feeling reeeaaal guilty about mine for 2013. I don&#8217;t think I wrote them anywhere besides my last blog, which I deleted from the Internet after what we&#8217;ll call a horrible miscommunication in regards to a post I wrote about dating. You wonder why I don&#8217;t write about it much. Yeaah&#8230;</p> 
  
  <p>
    Anyway, I decided to look back at my resolutions. And I am embarrassed. Maybe I put too much on my plate. Maybe I should just be resolved to not keep any of my resolutions, which, if kept, will make me a liar and which, if not kept, will still mean that I didn&#8217;t keep my resolution to not keep my resolutions, which means I&#8217;m still a liar. At any rate, let&#8217;s see how I&#8217;ve done.
  </p>
  
  <div>
    <b>1. Attend the temple on a consistent schedule each month &#8212;&nbsp;</b>This is what I&#8217;d like to call a loaded resolution. I did get to going once a week for awhile on the same day, but then I slept in and decided, <i>Meh. If I don&#8217;t just go on, say, Wednesdays, I&#8217;ll at least go some other time during the week</i>. And right now, I&#8217;ve done a poor job. I have gotten into the temple at least once a month the whole year, however, and that is an accomplishment to me.<br /><b>Resolution Status: basically kept.&nbsp;</b></p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>2. Read 50 books</b> &#8212; According to Goodreads, which sometimes lies to make me feel like more of a failure, I only read 21 books this year. Not even half. Last year I read 42. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO ME?! THAT&#8217;S NOT EVEN TWO BOOKS A MONTH. *dies* I still have two days left to stuff myself full of literature.<br /><b>Resolution Status: less than half kept.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>3. Finish Redd, the novel I started last year &#8212; </b>Um, I started it a little more. Does that count?<br /><b>Resolution Status: not kept.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>4. Make a habit of doing yoga every day </b>&#8212; This will likely be my resolution until the end of time.<br /><b>Resolution Status: not kept for the second to third year in a row.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>5. Work up to the point where I can climb 5.10 + walls </b>&#8212; I climbed a lot this summer, but the best I can do is a 5.8. I&#8217;m almost there.<br /><b>Resolution Status: trying.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>6. Hike Flat Top &#8212; finally! </b>&#8212; NEVAH!<br /><b>Resolution Status: not kept for fourth year in a row.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>7. Find one project to get behind that will help dozens, maybe even hundreds, of people </b>&#8212; This is vague and I&#8217;m not sure I know what project we&#8217;re talking about. Can we count Institute? My stake service projects? Signing the &#8220;I Stand with Phil Robertson&#8221; petition?<br /><b>Resolution Status: kept. For sure.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>8. Read the Lord of the Rings series </b>&#8212; I read <i>The Hobbit</i>, which, as many pseudo and genuine Tolkein-obsessees would say: &#8220;DOESN&#8217;T COUNT!&#8221; I have started <i>The Fellowship</i>, though, so I&#8217;m well on my way to starting this resolution by the time it&#8217;s too late. Yay for me.<br /><b>Resolution Status: not kept.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>9. Get an internship</b>&nbsp;&#8212; KEPT! Almost twice, as I almost chose to have two internships this semester. It&#8217;s probably a good thing that didn&#8217;t work out.<br /><b>Resolution Status: KEPT.</b><br /><b><br /></b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>10. Eat at Chili&#8217;s for the first time </b>&#8212; Alas, my lips may never taste the heavenly goodness of a lava cake for years to come. I&#8217;m too unmotivated and too broke.<br /><b>Resolution Status: not kept.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>11. Make a galaxy print scarf </b>&#8212; I forgot that I wanted to do this.<br /><b>Resolution Status: not kept.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>12. Find a quiet place to think/write </b>&#8212; This is an odd one. So far, the best I&#8217;ve been able to find is in the Institute Council room and Institute library, neither of which I have used properly to think or write or in quiet. So&#8230;yes, but no.<br /><b>Resolution Status: technically kept.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>13. Make a writing schedule for myself </b>&#8212; I am an embarrassment to my chosen field.<br /><b>Resolution Status: definitely not kept.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>14. Read scriptures at least 15 minutes a day </b>&#8212; At the beginning of the year, I was awesome. And then, I got less and less awesome.<br /><b>Resolution Status: kept then not kept.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>15. Finish This is the Christ </b>&#8212; Um&#8230;coughcoughstartthisisthechristcough.<br /><b>Resolution Status: coughforgottenaboutcough</b><br /><b><br /></b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>16. Get published somewhere</b>&nbsp;&#8212; SUCCESS! I had my graphic skills published on a book cover. Not the publication medium I had planned on, but still publication!<br /><b>Resolution Status: kept.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>17. Build a stronger relationship with my brothers </b>&#8212; With all seriousness, I think I can say that I kept this one. It isn&#8217;t a perfect relationship, by any means, but it is a much healthier one than that of a few years ago.<br /><b>Resolution Status: kept.&nbsp;</b></p>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <b>18. Manage fear </b>&#8212; I guess you could say I&#8217;ve learned how to manage fear, but not entirely. Overcoming it is what I need to work on.<br /><b>Resolution Status: kept. Sorta.&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b>So I guess it&#8217;s:<br /><b>Resolutions: 11</b><br /><b>Ari: 7&nbsp;</b><br /><b><br /></b>Here&#8217;s to hoping next year I&#8217;ll be more motivated. And finally eat my lava cake after a morning of intense warrior poses.&nbsp;
