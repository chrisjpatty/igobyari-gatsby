<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  Everyone gravitates to you, every girl you want, every girl who wants you. You barely hung around enough in my life to earn a number, that single separation between Number Four and I. But you&#8217;re both the same where it counts and where it hurts &#8212; love of climbing, propensity to lead a girl on, even if you didn&#8217;t mean to, a painful lack of patience when it comes to weakness I&#8217;ve struggled with my whole life.</p>

    Goodbye, Number Five. Even if I expected you to one day text me back, I&#8217;d never be your escape from boredom again.&nbsp;
  </div>
