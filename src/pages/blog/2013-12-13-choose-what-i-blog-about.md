  Guess what, world? Finals are OVERSVILLE. Do you know what that means? I can and probably will blog to my heart&#8217;s content.</p> 
  
  <p>
    Over the past couple of weeks, I&#8217;ve had lots and lots and LOTS of opinions and thoughts build up with no time or place to release them. Now that I have time, it&#8217;s all a matter of what to write about first.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That&#8217;s where you come in.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I realize that my blog&#8217;s not super great and not a lot of people read it, but some do, and I&#8217;d love to be able to talk about things that you want to talk about. That being said, I&#8217;ve made a fancy poll (right below this stuff) with some of the things I&#8217;ve been dying to write about. Please vote for what you&#8217;d like to see on my blog! Don&#8217;t see anything that interests you? Well, leave it in the comment section. You can vote for as many as you&#8217;d like, <span style="font-weight: bold;">however, I&#8217;d encourage you to only vote for 2-4</span><i style="font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</i>so that I can keep track of everything.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So what are you waiting for? Go vote! This poll ends in a week. You have until then.
  </p>
