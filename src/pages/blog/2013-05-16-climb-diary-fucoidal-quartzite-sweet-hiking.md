Commentary: Fucoidal Quartzite is probably my favorite area in the canyon. Lots of fantastic and challenging walls to climb. After climbing, Kori and I went on a short hike upward, and it was just gorgeous. We may or may not have risked our lives by doing this . . . coughcough.

Kori and I decided that our climbing motto is now, “Wow! What a hold!” 

Exhibit A (from Home Alone): 

Only problem is that when we shout it at each other, we laugh too hard to climb.

Thanks for reading.  
Happy trails, everybody!
