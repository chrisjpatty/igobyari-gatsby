<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  I&#8217;m tired.</p> 
  
  <p>
    I&#8217;m tired and I&#8217;m grumpy and I&#8217;m bossy and I&#8217;m . . . uuuuugggggh.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Holding down one job is hard. Holding down three is insane. I edited photos this morning, worked at the bakery this afternoon, and I&#8217;ve been editing essays since 9 pm this evening. I&#8217;ve been <i>aching </i>to write something, something real and personal (don&#8217;t know if I mentioned this, but I&#8217;m writing a nonfiction novel about being shy and how shyness is treated ridiculously in this country). BUT I DON&#8217;T HAVE DANG TIME.

    My nickname for myself is Everything Girl. I try so hard to be and do everything, but it&#8217;s impossible. It always has been. I&#8217;m a half-baked entrepreneur &#8212; I started a photo business, and it&#8217;s struggling/overwhelming at the same time; I started an online LDS magazine, and it&#8217;s practically crashed and burned; I wanted to form a hiking club, but that ain&#8217;t happening. I&#8217;ve been so concerned with having a social life that my social life isn&#8217;t even at normal, humane times anymore.

  <p>
    I&#8217;m so burnt.&nbsp;
