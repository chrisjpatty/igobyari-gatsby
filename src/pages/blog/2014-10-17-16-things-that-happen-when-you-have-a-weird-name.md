**1\. Random old women make it their business to inform your parents that you will be bullied when you grow up. **

A’right. Thanks, lady, for your kind, encouraging words about my future.

**2\. Browsing keychain stands at the store becomes a regular and pointless occurrence that always ends in heartbreak, but you always do it anyway. Kind of like having a high school crush.  **

“Oh, wait! Could it be?! I see an A! And an R! And an I! And it says…Arin. Not Arianna, Arin.”

WHYYY.

**3\. You have to write your name out for people or they will not spell it right. Ever. **

**4\. You become a walking kiosk. **

“What were you named after?” 

“What culture is your name from?” 

“Are you Italian or Irish by chance?” 

“What made your parents give you such a…different name?”

**5\. On the first day of school, you sit through the entire roll, just waiting for it…**

“Betty Reeder?” 

“Here.” 

“Margaret Reen?” 

“Here.”  

![Dramatic pause](https://www.igobyari.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4ee1a8f009dadcb1abc8968abf0c86f8.gif)

“………………………………..uh………………………uh……….ah-Ahreeawna Reez?”

**6\. Your classmates immediately assume you’re a sassy little know-it-all when you make due corrections. **

“Uh, actually, it’s Arianna. Pronounced eh-ree-aaa-nuh.”

**7\. Your teachers, colleagues, and acquaintances pride themselves on remembering your name, but they still pronounce it wrong. **

“Oh! Arena! I got this!”

**8\. You correct them, but immediately afterward, they mispronounce it again. **

Me: “It’s actually Arianna. Like air–e–aaaaaa–nuh.” 

Them: “Oh! I knew that. Arrrrrrrrr-ee-aw-nah. Right?”

Me: “Right…”

**9\. People read your name off of lists and insert random letters that don’t belong in your business. **

“Adrianna Rees, please come forward.”

E’scuse me? Who you talkin’ ’bout? 

**10. ****Contractions and word equations become your new best friends. **

“Here. It’s like…air and banana. Think air plus banana and you’ve got it.”

**11. ****Your teachers, colleagues, and acquaintances never quite get your name right and then they confuse it with your younger siblings’ names. **

“Oh! Korianna! Right? Or no. Ariel!”

**12\. Sparing them the pain of embarrassment and sparing yourself the pain of having to pronounce your name for the fifty billionth time, you lie to them. **

Yup! That’s how you pronounce it alright.

**13\. You stop being surprised when your name is misspelled on official/important documents. **

You’re still friggin’ miffed, though.

Yeah. That was my National Scholar certificate. It’s not like it’s a BIG DEAL OR ANYTHING.

**14\. Your colleagues refuse to use the shortened, easy version of your name because it, too, is weird. **

“Wait. You go by Ari? Like…airy? Let’s not call you that unless you dye your hair blonde. Haha.”

**15\. You just learn to accept your fate. **

People are going to call me weird names. Such is life.

**16\. Then, out of the blue one day, someone nails your name on the first try and it feels like you just single-handedly collapsed the Empire, saved the galaxy, and are now having a dance party with Ewoks.  **

It’s all worth it for that one time.
