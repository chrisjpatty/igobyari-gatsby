    Sometimes I wake up and think to myself, <i>There&#8217;s </i>no way <i>this day will be any different than yesterday or the day before yesterday. </i>That&#8217;s a terribly dreary way to think.<br />But when you&#8217;re 21 and soon to graduate college and working all summer and seem to not be going anywhere fast, that&#8217;s how you start thinking. The only way to differentiate this day from that day is to really stop and reflect about them, to re-realize that you are still alive, still doing well.

    So, hi. My name is Ari, and I am still alive, still doing relatively well.

    I go to work sometimes and I get super messy, to the point where I&#8217;m self-conscious of going out and indecently exposing customers to the carnage of chocolate Ready Ice.<br />Sometimes I realize that there are a couple of super attractive coworkers there and that I always seem to act like an idiot whenever either of them are around. I often like to imagine holding hands and walking through the grocery store on a date because it sounds like the most oddly romantic thing in the world. I sit back and watch people talk and laugh in the produce department, and I realize just how handy it is to have grocery stores at a time when people don&#8217;t communicate with each other like they should or as often as they should. I go home with my feet aching and my hat hair all akimbo, but I feel good.

    I do internship work sometimes. This week I got to hold an anthology that my friend Ariel and I designed all on our own. It was so beautiful that I wanted to cry. I felt like I&#8217;d done something incredibly great, and that felt incredibly great.

    I worry about tuition sometimes, because I was dumb and procrastinated getting my paperwork turned in. I&#8217;m going to need a miracle to be able to pay it off before they purge my schedule, especially since I just don&#8217;t have the money to do so. But I&#8217;m hanging onto faith, and it&#8217;s comforting to realize that no matter what happens, I&#8217;ll be okay.
  </p>

    I fail at dating sometimes. One bad side effect of being kind of introverted is the inability to realize that when I should be flirting, I&#8217;m being too aloof and<i>&nbsp;</i>when I should be aloof, I&#8217;m being too flirty. I discovered recently that I have every power within me to turn on the aloof button when it needs to be turned on. Now, if only I could turn on the flirt button when it needs to be turned on so that I don&#8217;t miscommunicate my emotions. Sigh.

    Last Friday there was a huge stake dance, and because I was standing around like the partial wallflower that I am, some guy danced by with a girl, shoved an empty plastic cup in my hands, and said, &#8220;Could you hold this for me? Thanks.&#8221; And my inner Johnny Raincloud was like, &#8220;So now I&#8217;m a human trash can. Great.&#8221; That is my life sometimes, people.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I have to wear stupid, migraine-inducing glasses sometimes, I watch Arthur sometimes, I read books in my room all day sometimes, and sometimes, I just blog, even though I&#8217;m convinced that I should have waited until I was engaged to start a blog, because then people would be compelled to care about the many details of my life.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But this is life. Boring, charming, chugging along.
