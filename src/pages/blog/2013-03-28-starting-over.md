Today I discovered why I’ve had such an attitude about dating lately: it’s mainly me.

Let’s be honest. I’m picky, I’m a bit a flighty, I do not just hand people my heart. I set huge expectations that seem to always fall apart. When someone gives me an inch of space, I run a mile . . . away. And I always end up in stupid situations.

UGHHHHHH. Tempered with the fact that I’ve got a major attraction to Number Five, my relationships with other guys are just not happening.

So I’m starting over. Clean slate. Maybe I should take a break from dating guys to just date myself for awhile, really come to understand who I am and what I want/need first.

That actually is not a bad idea.
