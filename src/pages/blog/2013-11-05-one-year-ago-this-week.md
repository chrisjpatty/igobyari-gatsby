<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  soaking carpet of yellow<br />spilled leaves, exposed trees<br />stepping out of your truck<br />into dead November<br />with no words left</p> 
  
  <p>
    i was eighteen all over again
  </p>
  
  <p>
    we were nothing,<br />went nowhere,<br />developing,<br />but washed out by<br />the door we both pushed <br />and left<br />open,<br />you with force,<br />me with fear
  </p>
  
  <p>
    the only photographs left<br />are those of me, alone,<br />you, involved again
  </p>
  
  <p>
    this new girl&#8217;s cute
  </p>
  
  <p>
    i&#8217;m over you,<br />but not over how it felt<br />felt to be intriguing,<br />admirable,<br />lovable
  </p>
  
  <p>
    if only for a few hours<br />so few hours that they<br />feel like an eternity
  </p>
  
  <p>
    a year
  </p>
  
  <p>
    what i would have said if then were now:<br /><i>i&#8217;m trying, i want you to understand, please be patient</i><br />what i would have done if then were now:<br /><i>put my arms around you and shown you how important you felt to me&nbsp;</i><br />how it would have ended if then were now:<br />me<i> closing my door on </i>you<i>, asking </i>you <i>to leave</i><br /><i><br /></i><i>it didn&#8217;t make either of us happy &nbsp;&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i>one long year later,<br />i remember who we were
  </p>
  
  <p>
    and i work hard to be unrecognizable
  </p>
  
  <p>
    </div>
