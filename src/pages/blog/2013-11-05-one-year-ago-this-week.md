soaking carpet of yellow  
spilled leaves, exposed trees  
stepping out of your truck  
into dead November  
with no words left

i was eighteen all over again

we were nothing,  
went nowhere,  
developing,  
but washed out by  
the door we both pushed  
and left  
open,  
you with force,  
me with fear

the only photographs left  
are those of me, alone,  
you, involved again

this new girl’s cute

i’m over you,  
but not over how it felt  
felt to be intriguing,  
admirable,  
lovable

if only for a few hours  
so few hours that they  
feel like an eternity

a year

what i would have said if then were now:  
_i’m trying, i want you to understand, please be patient_  
what i would have done if then were now:  
_put my arms around you and shown you how important you felt to me _  
how it would have ended if then were now:  
me _closing my door on_ you_, asking_ you _to leave_  
_it didn’t make either of us happy   _  
one long year later,  
i remember who we were

and i work hard to be unrecognizable
