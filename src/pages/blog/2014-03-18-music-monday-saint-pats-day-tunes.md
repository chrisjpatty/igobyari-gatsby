Just ended my evening with corned beef, cream soda, and Flogging Molly blasting through my radio. ‘Tis the life, I tell ye! Happy Americanized Saint Patrick’s Day, everybody!

In honor of this strange holiday that I’ve never really had an inclination to celebrate before, here are some of my favorite tunes by Irish singers/groups: 

**Higher Love by James Vincent McMorrow:** his voice is the musical equivalent of milk and a cookie. 

**The Blower’s Daughter by Damien Rice:** another lovely voice.

**What You Know by Two Door Cinema Club:** because really. They’re great.

**The Devil’s Dance Floor by Flogging Molly:** get some real Irish tunes playing.
