Last night my family sat up on hard shingles with blankets to watch Logan fireworks flower in the distant sky. It was beautiful.

I wish every day could be a Fourth of July, that we could acknowledge the greatness of our country instead of criticizing and attacking each other over politics or gender equality or whatever issue rules the day. I hate that we do that so often, that so many of us can’t even tolerate one opinion that conflicts with our own. Who are we to say that another person’s opinion is wrong? Who are we to say that we have the corner on truth? We’re just Americans. We all are, and we would do well to remember it.

The Founders sacrificed so much, and we cannot do the same thing. Our country’s so large, that many things are inaccessible to us — protesting at Washington, racing to Lexington on horse, standing on street corners to read the new Declaration. We’re too big, too busy, and too bothered to do any of that.

But why can’t we stand up? We ARE the people, after all. This is OUR country, after all.

The sad fact of the matter is that the tyranny we see today happens within our own government, and are we so helpless that we cannot stand against it? Are we so apathetic that we’d let it happen? The Declaration of Independence quite literally declares that when “any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter and abolish it.” We settle way more than we attempt to alter our future.

Just because there is no King George today doesn’t mean that there isn’t fault and missteps within our own political system.

It is not the government itself that is broken and corrupt (though many would argue that), but it is the men we elect, the men who are supposed to take their turn to have a say and then step down. But we’ve allowed them to stay, to not give us a turn, and that is why we don’t have our voices heard. Because we are too unwilling to fight the battles ourselves.

So, what’s stopping you? Go sign petitions, post signs, protest near your courthouses and capitol buildings. Go wave flags and take stands and write your representatives. Go run for office. Whatever you do, do what is best for your country. Do what the Founders did and fight until you’re sweating and bleeding and crying, but you are free.

Happy Fourth of July, America. Go fight for her.
