<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
  Today I discovered why I&#8217;ve had such an attitude about dating lately: it&#8217;s mainly me.</p> 
  
  <p>
    Let&#8217;s be honest. I&#8217;m picky, I&#8217;m a bit a flighty, I do not just hand people my heart. I set huge expectations that seem to always fall apart. When someone gives me an inch of space, I run a mile . . . away. And I always end up in stupid situations.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    UGHHHHHH. Tempered with the fact that I&#8217;ve got a major attraction to Number Five, my relationships with other guys are just not happening.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So I&#8217;m starting over. Clean slate. Maybe I should take a break from dating guys to just date myself for awhile, really come to understand who I am and what I want/need first.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That actually is not a bad idea.&nbsp;
