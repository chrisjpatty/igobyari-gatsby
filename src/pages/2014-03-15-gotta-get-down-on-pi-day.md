        ^Nope. Didn&#8217;t actually read Life of Pi, although I&#8217;ve started to read it at least three times in my lifetime.

    So today I went to work. We ended up shoving a few tables up front, loading them with our 8 and 9&#8243; pies, and calling it a happy Pi Day. This is the first 3.14 I&#8217;ve worked, and it was rather anti-climactic, really. I had images of pie slices dangling from the ceiling and mini pies glittering like gold from our cake display case and pies the size of your thumbs. Like a pie-a-palooza! I can see why we didn&#8217;t go with that, though. My idea of Pi Day is basically get a heart attack and die day. &nbsp;

    I did end up eating my very first pie from said bakery, though! Weird, eh? I sometimes bake them, and yet, I&#8217;ve never eaten one. I am not a bad employee, I promise. Manhandling the merchandise just makes you not want to eat it.

    Today was, in general, just weird. I&#8217;ve been waiting to hear back about my interview, and I thought I&#8217;d hear from them today, or yesterday now, I guess. I haven&#8217;t yet. I don&#8217;t want to give up hope, but I&#8217;m starting to work through what I&#8217;ll be doing instead this fall, and it&#8217;s hard. I&#8217;ve been trembling all day long from the nerves. I iced some shamrock sugar cookies in about the same amount of time it would take for me to grow a beard. And I had to do little swirls around the edges to make them cutesy. Imagine, for a moment, trembling hands icing sugar cookies. Even if I could take pictures, I wouldn&#8217;t inflict the horror of my cookie icing skills on you. It&#8217;s too much to bear.&nbsp;

    So, yeah, I was kind of a wreck today. I sliced my hand open bouldering this week and I also somehow sliced my elbow, and yesterday, I got a paper cut the size of the Mariana Trench on my finger from a cake box. So I was all bandaged up. And trembling. And handling knives. And there was a wedding cake (remind me to talk about the aura of dread that hangs around the bakery whenever there&#8217;s a wedding cake to be picked up) and a giant cookie that I had the chance to ice like a cake, having no previous cake icing experience.&nbsp;

    High pressure day today, guys.

    A highlight of the day, though, was getting to show my friend Jamille the early Star Wars films for the first time.

    Final thoughts for the day:

    1. C-3PO is a complete tool bag.<br />2. I sometimes wish I could marry the young Harrison Ford.&nbsp;</div>
