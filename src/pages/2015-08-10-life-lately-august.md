    I&#8217;ve been thinking lately. A lot. So much so that my friends and family have had to snap me out of stupors where my head is a billion miles away. It&#8217;s hard to come back down from a billion miles away.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A few weeks ago, I had resigned myself to the sense that the world is an awful place. News is always bad and people are usually cruel. Sometimes it seems that way.Â But lately, I get this crazy feeling that I&#8217;m blind.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As I rode my bike home from Institute last week, I ended up on a lonely dirt road in the middle of nowhere that I&#8217;ve always hated to drive on. It was almost twilight. The sky was pink and peach above fields of alfalfa and wheat that crashed together. The only thing I could hear was the ticking of bicycle pawls, but then it seemed like an orchestra rose up to meet me. Horses mumbled in baritone from beneath a half-dilapidated stable right off the road. Frogs and crickets sang together from the cattails. A lamb bleated, a calf lowed, and a breeze snaked through my loose hair. It was incredibly romantic and incredibly peaceful. And incredibly not like the way I&#8217;ve been living my life this past year.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I&#8217;ve been so focused on names and numbers and figures that I&#8217;ve forgotten poetry. I&#8217;ve forgotten the way it feels to sit back and stare at some menial thing and see the magic of it. I&#8217;ve forgotten how it feels to find a verse in an interaction, an ode in a face, or a new story in an old place. I&#8217;ve forgotten why I wanted to be a writer to begin with: to catch wonder and put it somewhere where it can&#8217;t be fleeting. Only now have I been reminded.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m writing all of this here, because it gives you no big glimpse of my life. Work is stressful, school has become complicated and, as of today, I&#8217;m probably not going back now, I still occasionally feel the small wound of &#8216;what if&#8217; when I think about life.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But I&#8217;m alive, and I have stacks of words inside. And lately, they spill out of me. And the world is more beautiful than it&#8217;s ever felt.
